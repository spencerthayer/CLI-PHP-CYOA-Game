# Quickstart

> Get started with OpenRouter's unified API for hundreds of AI models. Learn how to integrate using OpenAI SDK, direct API calls, or third-party frameworks.

OpenRouter provides a unified API that gives you access to hundreds of AI models through a single endpoint, while automatically handling fallbacks and selecting the most cost-effective options. Get started with just a few lines of code using your preferred SDK or framework.

<Tip>
  Looking for information about free models and rate limits? Please see the [FAQ](/docs/faq#how-are-rate-limits-calculated)
</Tip>

In the examples below, the OpenRouter-specific headers are optional. Setting them allows your app to appear on the OpenRouter leaderboards. For detailed information about app attribution, see our [App Attribution guide](/docs/features/app-attribution).

## Using the OpenAI SDK

<CodeGroup>
  ```python title="Python"
  from openai import OpenAI

  client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
    api_key="<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>",
  )

  completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    extra_headers={
      "HTTP-Referer": "<YOUR_SITE_URL>", # Optional. Site URL for rankings on openrouter.ai.
      "X-Title": "<YOUR_SITE_NAME>", # Optional. Site title for rankings on openrouter.ai.
    },
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    messages=[
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is the meaning of life?"
      }
    ]
  )

  print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
  ```

  ```typescript title="TypeScript"
  import OpenAI from 'openai';

  const openai = new OpenAI({
    baseURL: 'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1',
    apiKey: '<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
    defaultHeaders: {
      'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>', // Optional. Site URL for rankings on openrouter.ai.
      'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>', // Optional. Site title for rankings on openrouter.ai.
    },
  });

  async function main() {
    const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: 'What is the meaning of life?',
        },
      ],
    });

    console.log(completion.choices[0].message);
  }

  main();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Using the OpenRouter API directly

<Tip>
  You can use the interactive [Request Builder](/request-builder) to generate OpenRouter API requests in the language of your choice.
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>
  ```python title="Python"
  import requests
  import json

  response = requests.post(
    url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions",
    headers={
      "Authorization": "Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>",
      "HTTP-Referer": "<YOUR_SITE_URL>", # Optional. Site URL for rankings on openrouter.ai.
      "X-Title": "<YOUR_SITE_NAME>", # Optional. Site title for rankings on openrouter.ai.
    },
    data=json.dumps({
      "model": "openai/gpt-4o", # Optional
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What is the meaning of life?"
        }
      ]
    })
  )
  ```

  ```typescript title="TypeScript"
  fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      Authorization: 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
      'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>', // Optional. Site URL for rankings on openrouter.ai.
      'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>', // Optional. Site title for rankings on openrouter.ai.
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: 'What is the meaning of life?',
        },
      ],
    }),
  });
  ```

  ```shell title="Shell"
  curl https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENROUTER_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is the meaning of life?"
      }
    ]
  }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The API also supports [streaming](/docs/api-reference/streaming).

# Frequently Asked Questions

> Find answers to commonly asked questions about OpenRouter's unified API, model access, pricing, and integration.

## Getting started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why should I use OpenRouter?">
    OpenRouter provides a unified API to access all the major LLM models on the
    market. It also allows users to aggregate their billing in one place and
    keep track of all of their usage using our analytics.

    OpenRouter passes through the pricing of the underlying providers, while pooling their uptime,
    so you get the same pricing you'd get from the provider directly, with a
    unified API and fallbacks so that you get much better uptime.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I get started with OpenRouter?">
    To get started, create an account and add credits on the
    [Credits](https://openrouter.ai/settings/credits) page. Credits are simply
    deposits on OpenRouter that you use for LLM inference.
    When you use the API or chat interface, we deduct the request cost from your
    credits. Each model and provider has a different price per million tokens.

    Once you have credits you can either use the chat room, or create API keys
    and start using the API. You can read our [quickstart](/docs/quickstart)
    guide for code samples and more.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I get support?">
    The best way to get support is to join our
    [Discord](https://discord.gg/fVyRaUDgxW) and ping us in the #help forum.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I get billed for my usage on OpenRouter?">
    For each model we have the pricing displayed per million tokens. There is
    usually a different price for prompt and completion tokens. There are also
    models that charge per request, for images and for reasoning tokens. All of
    these details will be visible on the models page.

    When you make a request to OpenRouter, we receive the total number of tokens processed
    by the provider. We then calculate the corresponding cost and deduct it from your credits.
    You can review your complete usage history in the [Activity tab](https://openrouter.ai/activity).

    You can also add the `usage: {include: true}` parameter to your chat request
    to get the usage information in the response.

    We pass through the pricing of the underlying providers; there is no markup
    on inference pricing (however we do charge a [fee](/docs/faq#pricing-and-fees) when purchasing credits).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Pricing and Fees

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are the fees for using OpenRouter?">
    OpenRouter charges a {getTotalFeeString('stripe')} fee when you purchase credits. We pass through
    the pricing of the underlying model providers without any markup, so you pay
    the same rate as you would directly with the provider.

    Crypto payments are charged a fee of {getTotalFeeString('coinbase')}.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a fee for using my own provider keys (BYOK)?">
    Yes, if you choose to use your own provider API keys (Bring Your Own Key -
    BYOK), there is a fee of{' '}
    {bn(openRouterBYOKFee.fraction).times(100).toString()}% of what the same
    model and provider would normally cost on OpenRouter. This fee is deducted
    from your OpenRouter credits. This allows you to manage your rate limits and
    costs directly with the provider while still leveraging OpenRouter's unified
    interface.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Models and Providers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What LLM models does OpenRouter support?">
    OpenRouter provides access to a wide variety of LLM models, including frontier models from major AI labs.
    For a complete list of models you can visit the [models browser](https://openrouter.ai/models) or fetch the list through the [models api](https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How frequently are new models added?">
    We work on adding models as quickly as we can. We often have partnerships with
    the labs releasing models and can release models as soon as they are
    available. If there is a model missing that you'd like OpenRouter to support, feel free to message us on
    [Discord](https://discord.gg/fVyRaUDgxW).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are model variants?">
    Variants are suffixes that can be added to the model slug to change its behavior.

    Static variants can only be used with specific models and these are listed in our [models api](https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models).

    1. `:free` - The model is always provided for free and has low rate limits.
    2. `:beta` - The model is not moderated by OpenRouter.
    3. `:extended` - The model has longer than usual context length.
    4. `:thinking` - The model supports reasoning by default.

    Dynamic variants can be used on all models and they change the behavior of how the request is routed or used.

    1. `:online` - All requests will run a query to extract web results that are attached to the prompt.
    2. `:nitro` - Providers will be sorted by throughput rather than the default sort, optimizing for faster response times.
    3. `:floor` - Providers will be sorted by price rather than the default sort, prioritizing the most cost-effective options.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I am an inference provider, how can I get listed on OpenRouter?">
    You can read our requirements at the [Providers
    page](/docs/use-cases/for-providers). If you would like to contact us, the best
    place to reach us is over email.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the expected latency/response time for different models?">
    For each model on OpenRouter we show the latency (time to first token) and the token
    throughput for all providers. You can use this to estimate how long requests
    will take. If you would like to optimize for throughput you can use the
    `:nitro` variant to route to the fastest provider.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does model fallback work if a provider is unavailable?">
    If a provider returns an error OpenRouter will automatically fall back to the
    next provider. This happens transparently to the user and allows production
    apps to be much more resilient. OpenRouter has a lot of options to configure
    the provider routing behavior. The full documentation can be found [here](/docs/features/provider-routing).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## API Technical Specifications

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What authentication methods are supported?">
    OpenRouter uses three authentication methods:

    1. Cookie-based authentication for the web interface and chatroom
    2. API keys (passed as Bearer tokens) for accessing the completions API and other core endpoints
    3. [Provisioning API keys](/docs/features/provisioning-api-keys) for programmatically managing API keys through the key management endpoints
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are rate limits calculated?">
    For free models, rate limits are determined by the credits that you have purchased.
    If you have purchased at least {FREE_MODEL_CREDITS_THRESHOLD} credits, your free model rate limit will be {FREE_MODEL_HAS_CREDITS_RPD} requests per day.
    Otherwise, you will be rate limited to {FREE_MODEL_NO_CREDITS_RPD} free model API requests per day.

    You can learn more about how rate limits work for paid accounts in our [rate limits documentation](/docs/api-reference/limits).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What API endpoints are available?">
    OpenRouter implements the OpenAI API specification for /completions and
    /chat/completions endpoints, allowing you to use any model with the same
    request/response format. Additional endpoints like /api/v1/models are also
    available. See our [API documentation](/docs/api-reference/overview) for
    detailed specifications.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the supported formats?">
    The API supports text and images.
    [Images](/docs/api-reference/overview#images--multimodal) can be passed as
    URLs or base64 encoded images. PDF and other file types are coming soon.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does streaming work?">
    Streaming uses server-sent events (SSE) for real-time token delivery. Set
    `stream: true` in your request to enable streaming responses.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What SDK support is available?">
    OpenRouter is a drop-in replacement for OpenAI. Therefore, any SDKs that
    support OpenAI by default also support OpenRouter. Check out our
    [docs](/docs/community/open-ai-sdk) for more details.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Privacy and Data Logging

Please see our [Terms of Service](https://openrouter.ai/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://openrouter.ai/privacy).

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What data is logged during API use?">
    We log basic request metadata (timestamps, model used, token counts). Prompt
    and completion are not logged by default. We do zero logging of your prompts/completions,
    even if an error occurs, unless you opt-in to logging them.

    We have an opt-in [setting](https://openrouter.ai/settings/privacy) that
    lets users opt-in to log their prompts and completions in exchange for a 1%
    discount on usage costs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What data is logged during Chatroom use?">
    The same data privacy applies to the chatroom as the API. All conversations
    in the chatroom are stored locally on your device. Conversations will not sync across devices.
    It is possible to export and import conversations using the settings menu in the chatroom.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What third-party sharing occurs?">
    OpenRouter is a proxy that sends your requests to the model provider for it to be completed.
    We work with all providers to, when possible, ensure that prompts and completions are not logged or used for training.
    Providers that do log, or where we have been unable to confirm their policy, will not be routed to unless the model training
    toggle is switched on in the [privacy settings](https://openrouter.ai/settings/privacy) tab.

    If you specify [provider routing](/docs/features/provider-routing) in your request, but none of the providers
    match the level of privacy specified in your account settings, you will get an error and your request will not complete.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Credit and Billing Systems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What purchase options exist?">
    OpenRouter uses a credit system where the base currency is US dollars. All
    of the pricing on our site and API is denoted in dollars. Users can top up
    their balance manually or set up auto top up so that the balance is
    replenished when it gets below the set threshold.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do credits expire?">
    Per our [terms](https://openrouter.ai/terms), we reserve the right to expire
    unused credits after one year of purchase.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My credits haven't showed up in my account">
    If you paid using Stripe, sometimes there is an issue with the Stripe
    integration and credits can get delayed in showing up on your account. Please allow up to one hour.
    If your credits still have not appeared after an hour, contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/fVyRaUDgxW) and we will
    look into it.

    If you paid using crypto, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/fVyRaUDgxW)
    and we will look into it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the refund policy?">
    Refunds for unused Credits may be requested within twenty-four (24) hours from the time the transaction was processed. If no refund request is received within twenty-four (24) hours following the purchase, any unused Credits become non-refundable. To request a refund within the eligible period, you can use the refund button on the [Credits](https://openrouter.ai/settings/credits) page. The unused credit amount will be refunded to your payment method; the platform fees are non-refundable. Note that cryptocurrency payments are never refundable.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How to monitor credit usage?">
    The [Activity](https://openrouter.ai/activity) page allows users to view
    their historic usage and filter the usage by model, provider and api key.

# Principles

> Learn about OpenRouter's guiding principles and mission. Understand our commitment to price optimization, standardized APIs, and high availability in AI model deployment.

OpenRouter helps developers source and optimize AI usage. We believe the future is multi-model and multi-provider.

## Why OpenRouter?

**Price and Performance**. OpenRouter scouts for the best prices, the lowest latencies, and the highest throughput across dozens of providers, and lets you choose how to [prioritize](/docs/features/provider-routing) them.

**Standardized API**. No need to change code when switching between models or providers. You can even let your users [choose and pay for their own](/docs/use-cases/oauth-pkce).

**Real-World Insights**. Be the first to take advantage of new models. See real-world data of [how often models are used](https://openrouter.ai/rankings) for different purposes. Keep up to date in our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/1091220969173028894/1094454198688546826).

**Consolidated Billing**. Simple and transparent billing, regardless of how many providers you use.

**Higher Availability**. Fallback providers, and automatic, smart routing means your requests still work even when providers go down.

**Higher Rate Limits**. OpenRouter works directly with providers to provide better rate limits and more throughput.

# Models

> Access all major language models (LLMs) through OpenRouter's unified API. Browse available models, compare capabilities, and integrate with your preferred provider.

Explore and browse 400+ models and providers [on our website](/models), or [with our API](/docs/api-reference/list-available-models) (including RSS).

## Models API Standard

Our [Models API](/docs/api-reference/list-available-models) makes the most important information about all LLMs freely available as soon as we confirm it.

### API Response Schema

The Models API returns a standardized JSON response format that provides comprehensive metadata for each available model. This schema is cached at the edge and designed for reliable integration for production applications.

#### Root Response Object

```json
{
  "data": [
    /* Array of Model objects */
  ]
}
```

#### Model Object Schema

Each model in the `data` array contains the following standardized fields:

| Field                  | Type                                          | Description                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                   | `string`                                      | Unique model identifier used in API requests (e.g., `"google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview"`) |
| `canonical_slug`       | `string`                                      | Permanent slug for the model that never changes                                        |
| `name`                 | `string`                                      | Human-readable display name for the model                                              |
| `created`              | `number`                                      | Unix timestamp of when the model was added to OpenRouter                               |
| `description`          | `string`                                      | Detailed description of the model's capabilities and characteristics                   |
| `context_length`       | `number`                                      | Maximum context window size in tokens                                                  |
| `architecture`         | `Architecture`                                | Object describing the model's technical capabilities                                   |
| `pricing`              | `Pricing`                                     | Lowest price structure for using this model                                            |
| `top_provider`         | `TopProvider`                                 | Configuration details for the primary provider                                         |
| `per_request_limits`   | Rate limiting information (null if no limits) |                                                                                        |
| `supported_parameters` | `string[]`                                    | Array of supported API parameters for this model                                       |

#### Architecture Object

```typescript
{
  "input_modalities": string[], // Supported input types: ["file", "image", "text"]
  "output_modalities": string[], // Supported output types: ["text"]
  "tokenizer": string,          // Tokenization method used
  "instruct_type": string | null // Instruction format type (null if not applicable)
}
```

#### Pricing Object

All pricing values are in USD per token/request/unit. A value of `"0"` indicates the feature is free.

```typescript
{
  "prompt": string,           // Cost per input token
  "completion": string,       // Cost per output token
  "request": string,          // Fixed cost per API request
  "image": string,           // Cost per image input
  "web_search": string,      // Cost per web search operation
  "internal_reasoning": string, // Cost for internal reasoning tokens
  "input_cache_read": string,   // Cost per cached input token read
  "input_cache_write": string   // Cost per cached input token write
}
```

#### Top Provider Object

```typescript
{
  "context_length": number,        // Provider-specific context limit
  "max_completion_tokens": number, // Maximum tokens in response
  "is_moderated": boolean         // Whether content moderation is applied
}
```

#### Supported Parameters

The `supported_parameters` array indicates which OpenAI-compatible parameters work with each model:

* `tools` - Function calling capabilities
* `tool_choice` - Tool selection control
* `max_tokens` - Response length limiting
* `temperature` - Randomness control
* `top_p` - Nucleus sampling
* `reasoning` - Internal reasoning mode
* `include_reasoning` - Include reasoning in response
* `structured_outputs` - JSON schema enforcement
* `response_format` - Output format specification
* `stop` - Custom stop sequences
* `frequency_penalty` - Repetition reduction
* `presence_penalty` - Topic diversity
* `seed` - Deterministic outputs

<Note title="Different models tokenize text in different ways">
  Some models break up text into chunks of multiple characters (GPT, Claude,
  Llama, etc), while others tokenize by character (PaLM). This means that token
  counts (and therefore costs) will vary between models, even when inputs and
  outputs are the same. Costs are displayed and billed according to the
  tokenizer for the model in use. You can use the `usage` field in the response
  to get the token counts for the input and output.
</Note>

If there are models or providers you are interested in that OpenRouter doesn't have, please tell us about them in our [Discord channel](https://openrouter.ai/discord).

## For Providers

If you're interested in working with OpenRouter, you can learn more on our [providers page](/docs/use-cases/for-providers).

# Privacy, Logging, and Data Collection

> Learn how OpenRouter & its providers handle your data, including logging and data collection.

When using AI through OpenRouter, whether via the chat interface or the API, your prompts and responses go through multiple touchpoints. You have control over how your data is handled at each step.

This page is designed to give a practical overview of how your data is handled, stored, and used. More information is available in the [privacy policy](/privacy) and [terms of service](/terms).

## Within OpenRouter

OpenRouter does not store your prompts or responses, *unless* you have explicitly opted in to prompt logging in your account settings. It's as simple as that.

OpenRouter samples a small number of prompts for categorization to power our reporting and model ranking. If you are not opted in to prompt logging, any categorization of your prompts is stored completely anonymously and never associated with your account or user ID. The categorization is done by model with a zero-data-retention policy.

OpenRouter does store metadata (e.g. number of prompt and completion tokens, latency, etc) for each request. This is used to power our reporting and model ranking, and your [activity feed](/activity).

## Provider Policies

### Training on Prompts

Each provider on OpenRouter has its own data handling policies. We reflect those policies in structured data on each AI endpoint that we offer.

On your account settings page, you can set whether you would like to allow routing to providers that may train on your data (according to their own policies). There are separate settings for paid and free models.

Wherever possible, OpenRouter works with providers to ensure that prompts will not be trained on, but there are exceptions. If you opt out of training in your account settings, OpenRouter will not route to providers that train. This setting has no bearing on OpenRouter's own policies and what we do with your prompts.

<Tip title="Data Policy Filtering">
  You can [restrict individual requests](/docs/features/provider-routing#requiring-providers-to-comply-with-data-policies)
  to only use providers with a certain data policy.

  This is also available as an account-wide setting in [your privacy settings](https://openrouter.ai/settings/privacy).
</Tip>

### Data Retention & Logging

Providers also have their own data retention policies, often for compliance reasons. OpenRouter does not have routing rules that change based on data retention policies of providers, but the retention policies as reflected in each provider's terms are shown below. Any user of OpenRouter can ignore providers that don't meet their own data retention requirements.

The full terms of service for each provider are linked from the provider's page, and aggregated in the [documentation](/docs/features/provider-routing#terms-of-service).

<ProviderDataRetentionTable />

# Zero Data Retention

> Learn how OpenRouter gives you control over your data

Zero Data Retention (ZDR) means that a provider will not store your data for any period of time.

OpenRouter has a [setting](/settings/privacy) that, when enabled, only allows you to route to endpoints that have a Zero Data Retention policy.

Providers that do not retain your data are also unable to train on your data. However we do have some endpoints & providers who do not train on your data but *do* retain it (e.g. to scan for abuse or for legal reasons). OpenRouter gives you controls over both of these policies.

## How OpenRouter Manages Data Policies

OpenRouter works with providers to understand each of their data policies and structures the policy data in a way that gives you control over which providers you want to route to.

Note that a provider's general policy may differ from the specific policy for a given endpoint. OpenRouter keeps track of the specific policy for each endpoint, works with providers to keep these policies up to date, and in some cases creates special agreements with providers to ensure data retention or training policies that are more privacy-focused than their default policies.

<Note>
  If OpenRouter is not able to establish or ascertain a clear policy for a provider or endpoint, we take a conservative stance and assume that the endpoint both retains and trains on data and mark it as such.
</Note>

A full list of providers and their data policies can be found [here](/docs/features/privacy-and-logging#data-retention--logging). Note that this list shows the default policy for each provider; if there is a particular endpoint that has a policy that differs from the provider default, it may not be available if "ZDR Only" is enabled.

## Caching

Some endpoints/models provide implicit caching of prompts. This keeps repeated prompt data in an in-memory cache in the provider's datacenter, so that the repeated part of the prompt does not need to be re-processed. This can lead to considerable cost savings.

OpenRouter has taken the stance that in-memory caching of prompts is *not* considered "retaining" data, and we therefore allow endpoints/models with implicit caching to be hit when a ZDR routing policy is in effect.

## OpenRouter's Retention Policy

OpenRouter itself has a ZDR policy; your prompts are not retained unless you specifically opt in to prompt logging.

## Zero Retention Endpoints

The following endpoints have a ZDR policy. Note that this list is also available progammatically via [https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/endpoints/zdr](https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/endpoints/zdr). It is automatically updated when there are changes to a provider's data policy.:

# Model Routing

> Route requests dynamically between AI models. Learn how to use OpenRouter's Auto Router and model fallback features for optimal performance and reliability.

OpenRouter provides two options for model routing.

## Auto Router

The [Auto Router](https://openrouter.ai/openrouter/auto), a special model ID that you can use to choose between selected high-quality models based on your prompt, powered by [NotDiamond](https://www.notdiamond.ai/).

```json
{
  "model": "openrouter/auto",
  ... // Other params
}
```

The resulting generation will have `model` set to the model that was used.

## The `models` parameter

The `models` parameter lets you automatically try other models if the primary model's providers are down, rate-limited, or refuse to reply due to content moderation.

```json
{
  "models": ["anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet", "gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b"],
  ... // Other params
}
```

If the model you selected returns an error, OpenRouter will try to use the fallback model instead. If the fallback model is down or returns an error, OpenRouter will return that error.

By default, any error can trigger the use of a fallback model, including context length validation errors, moderation flags for filtered models, rate-limiting, and downtime.

Requests are priced using the model that was ultimately used, which will be returned in the `model` attribute of the response body.

## Using with OpenAI SDK

To use the `models` array with the OpenAI SDK, include it in the `extra_body` parameter. In the example below, gpt-4o will be tried first, and the `models` array will be tried in order as fallbacks.

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript
    import OpenAI from 'openai';

    const openrouterClient = new OpenAI({
      baseURL: 'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1',
      // API key and headers
    });

    async function main() {
      // @ts-expect-error
      const completion = await openrouterClient.chat.completions.create({
        model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
        models: ['anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet', 'gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b'],
        messages: [
          {
            role: 'user',
            content: 'What is the meaning of life?',
          },
        ],
      });
      console.log(completion.choices[0].message);
    }

    main();
    ```

    ```python
    from openai import OpenAI

    openai_client = OpenAI(
      base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
      api_key={{API_KEY_REF}},
    )

    completion = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="openai/gpt-4o",
        extra_body={
            "models": ["anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet", "gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b"],
        },
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "What is the meaning of life?"
            }
        ]
    )

    print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
    ```

# Provider Routing

> Route AI model requests across multiple providers intelligently. Learn how to optimize for cost, performance, and reliability with OpenRouter's provider routing.

OpenRouter routes requests to the best available providers for your model. By default, [requests are load balanced](#price-based-load-balancing-default-strategy) across the top providers to maximize uptime.

You can customize how your requests are routed using the `provider` object in the request body for [Chat Completions](/docs/api-reference/chat-completion) and [Completions](/docs/api-reference/completion).

<Tip>
  For a complete list of valid provider names to use in the API, see the [full
  provider schema](#json-schema-for-provider-preferences).
</Tip>

The `provider` object can contain the following fields:

| Field                | Type              | Default | Description                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `order`              | string\[]         | -       | List of provider slugs to try in order (e.g. `["anthropic", "openai"]`). [Learn more](#ordering-specific-providers)               |
| `allow_fallbacks`    | boolean           | `true`  | Whether to allow backup providers when the primary is unavailable. [Learn more](#disabling-fallbacks)                             |
| `require_parameters` | boolean           | `false` | Only use providers that support all parameters in your request. [Learn more](#requiring-providers-to-support-all-parameters-beta) |
| `data_collection`    | "allow" \| "deny" | "allow" | Control whether to use providers that may store data. [Learn more](#requiring-providers-to-comply-with-data-policies)             |
| `only`               | string\[]         | -       | List of provider slugs to allow for this request. [Learn more](#allowing-only-specific-providers)                                 |

| `sort`               | string            | -       | Sort providers by price or throughput. (e.g. `"price"` or `"throughput"`). [Learn more](#provider-sorting)                        |
| `max_price`          | object            | -       | The maximum pricing you want to pay for this request. [Learn more](#maximum-price)                                                |

## Price-Based Load Balancing (Default Strategy)

For each model in your request, OpenRouter's default behavior is to load balance requests across providers, prioritizing price.

If you are more sensitive to throughput than price, you can use the `sort` field to explicitly prioritize throughput.

<Tip>
  When you send a request with `tools` or `tool_choice`, OpenRouter will only
  route to providers that support tool use. Similarly, if you set a
  `max_tokens`, then OpenRouter will only route to providers that support a
  response of that length.
</Tip>

Here is OpenRouter's default load balancing strategy:

1. Prioritize providers that have not seen significant outages in the last 30 seconds.
2. For the stable providers, look at the lowest-cost candidates and select one weighted by inverse square of the price (example below).
3. Use the remaining providers as fallbacks.

<Note title="A Load Balancing Example">
  If Provider A costs \$1 per million tokens, Provider B costs \$2, and Provider C costs \$3, and Provider B recently saw a few outages.

  * Your request is routed to Provider A. Provider A is 9x more likely to be first routed to Provider A than Provider C because $(1 / 3^2 = 1/9)$ (inverse square of the price).
  * If Provider A fails, then Provider C will be tried next.
  * If Provider C also fails, Provider B will be tried last.
</Note>

If you have `sort` or `order` set in your provider preferences, load balancing will be disabled.

## Provider Sorting

As described above, OpenRouter load balances based on price, while taking uptime into account.

If you instead want to *explicitly* prioritize a particular provider attribute, you can include the `sort` field in the `provider` preferences. Load balancing will be disabled, and the router will try providers in order.

The three sort options are:

* `"price"`: prioritize lowest price
* `"throughput"`: prioritize highest throughput
* `"latency"`: prioritize lowest latency

<TSFetchCodeBlock
  title="Example with Fallbacks Enabled"
  uriPath="/api/v1/chat/completions"
  body={{
    model: 'meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    provider: {
      sort: 'throughput',
    },
  }}
/>

To *always* prioritize low prices, and not apply any load balancing, set `sort` to `"price"`.

To *always* prioritize low latency, and not apply any load balancing, set `sort` to `"latency"`.

## Nitro Shortcut

You can append `:nitro` to any model slug as a shortcut to sort by throughput. This is exactly equivalent to setting `provider.sort` to `"throughput"`.

<TSFetchCodeBlock
  title="Example using Nitro shortcut"
  uriPath="/api/v1/chat/completions"
  body={{
    model: 'meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct:nitro',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
  }}
/>

## Floor Price Shortcut

You can append `:floor` to any model slug as a shortcut to sort by price. This is exactly equivalent to setting `provider.sort` to `"price"`.

<TSFetchCodeBlock
  title="Example using Floor shortcut"
  uriPath="/api/v1/chat/completions"
  body={{
    model: 'meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct:floor',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
  }}
/>

## Ordering Specific Providers

You can set the providers that OpenRouter will prioritize for your request using the `order` field.

| Field   | Type      | Default | Description                                                              |
| ------- | --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `order` | string\[] | -       | List of provider slugs to try in order (e.g. `["anthropic", "openai"]`). |

The router will prioritize providers in this list, and in this order, for the model you're using. If you don't set this field, the router will [load balance](#price-based-load-balancing-default-strategy) across the top providers to maximize uptime.

<Tip>
  You can use the copy button next to provider names on model pages to get the exact provider slug,
  including any variants like "/turbo". See [Targeting Specific Provider Endpoints](#targeting-specific-provider-endpoints) for details.
</Tip>

OpenRouter will try them one at a time and proceed to other providers if none are operational. If you don't want to allow any other providers, you should [disable fallbacks](#disabling-fallbacks) as well.

### Example: Specifying providers with fallbacks

This example skips over OpenAI (which doesn't host Mixtral), tries Together, and then falls back to the normal list of providers on OpenRouter:

<TSFetchCodeBlock
  title="Example with Fallbacks Enabled"
  uriPath="/api/v1/chat/completions"
  body={{
    model: 'mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    provider: {
      order: ['openai', 'together'],
    },
  }}
/>

### Example: Specifying providers with fallbacks disabled

Here's an example with `allow_fallbacks` set to `false` that skips over OpenAI (which doesn't host Mixtral), tries Together, and then fails if Together fails:

<TSFetchCodeBlock
  title="Example with Fallbacks Disabled"
  uriPath="/api/v1/chat/completions"
  body={{
    model: 'mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    provider: {
      order: ['openai', 'together'],
      allow_fallbacks: false,
    },
  }}
/>

## Targeting Specific Provider Endpoints

Each provider on OpenRouter may host multiple endpoints for the same model, such as a default endpoint and a specialized "turbo" endpoint. To target a specific endpoint, you can use the copy button next to the provider name on the model detail page to obtain the exact provider slug.

For example, DeepInfra offers DeepSeek R1 through multiple endpoints:

* Default endpoint with slug `deepinfra`
* Turbo endpoint with slug `deepinfra/turbo`

By copying the exact provider slug and using it in your request's `order` array, you can ensure your request is routed to the specific endpoint you want:

<TSFetchCodeBlock
  title="Example targeting DeepInfra Turbo endpoint"
  uriPath="/api/v1/chat/completions"
  body={{
    model: 'deepseek/deepseek-r1',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    provider: {
      order: ['deepinfra/turbo'],
      allow_fallbacks: false,
    },
  }}
/>

This approach is especially useful when you want to consistently use a specific variant of a model from a particular provider.

## Requiring Providers to Support All Parameters

You can restrict requests only to providers that support all parameters in your request using the `require_parameters` field.

| Field                | Type    | Default | Description                                                     |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `require_parameters` | boolean | `false` | Only use providers that support all parameters in your request. |

With the default routing strategy, providers that don't support all the [LLM parameters](/docs/api-reference/parameters) specified in your request can still receive the request, but will ignore unknown parameters. When you set `require_parameters` to `true`, the request won't even be routed to that provider.

### Example: Excluding providers that don't support JSON formatting

For example, to only use providers that support JSON formatting:

<TSFetchCodeBlock
  uriPath="/api/v1/chat/completions"
  body={{
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    provider: {
      require_parameters: true,
    },
    response_format: { type: 'json_object' },
  }}
/>

## Requiring Providers to Comply with Data Policies

You can restrict requests only to providers that comply with your data policies using the `data_collection` field.

| Field             | Type              | Default | Description                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `data_collection` | "allow" \| "deny" | "allow" | Control whether to use providers that may store data. |

* `allow`: (default) allow providers which store user data non-transiently and may train on it
* `deny`: use only providers which do not collect user data

Some model providers may log prompts, so we display them with a **Data Policy** tag on model pages. This is not a definitive source of third party data policies, but represents our best knowledge.

<Tip title="Account-Wide Data Policy Filtering">
  This is also available as an account-wide setting in [your privacy
  settings](https://openrouter.ai/settings/privacy). You can disable third party
  model providers that store inputs for training.
</Tip>

### Example: Excluding providers that don't comply with data policies

To exclude providers that don't comply with your data policies, set `data_collection` to `deny`:

<TSFetchCodeBlock
  uriPath="/api/v1/chat/completions"
  body={{
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    provider: {
      data_collection: 'deny', // or "allow"
    },
  }}
/>

## Disabling Fallbacks

To guarantee that your request is only served by the top (lowest-cost) provider, you can disable fallbacks.

This is combined with the `order` field from [Ordering Specific Providers](#ordering-specific-providers) to restrict the providers that OpenRouter will prioritize to just your chosen list.

<TSFetchCodeBlock
  uriPath="/api/v1/chat/completions"
  body={{
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    provider: {
      allow_fallbacks: false,
    },
  }}
/>

## Allowing Only Specific Providers

You can allow only specific providers for a request by setting the `only` field in the `provider` object.

| Field  | Type      | Default | Description                                       |
| ------ | --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `only` | string\[] | -       | List of provider slugs to allow for this request. |

<Warning>
  Only allowing some providers may significantly reduce fallback options and
  limit request recovery.
</Warning>

<Tip title="Account-Wide Allowed Providers">
  You can allow providers for all account requests by configuring your [preferences](/settings/preferences). This configuration applies to all API requests and chatroom messages.

  Note that when you allow providers for a specific request, the list of allowed providers is merged with your account-wide allowed providers.
</Tip>

### Example: Allowing Azure for a request calling GPT-4 Omni

Here's an example that will only use Azure for a request calling GPT-4 Omni:

<TSFetchCodeBlock
  uriPath="/api/v1/chat/completions"
  body={{
        model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
        messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
        provider: {
            only: ['azure'],
        },
    }}
/>

## Ignoring Providers

You can ignore providers for a request by setting the `ignore` field in the `provider` object.

| Field    | Type      | Default | Description                                      |
| -------- | --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `ignore` | string\[] | -       | List of provider slugs to skip for this request. |

<Warning>
  Ignoring multiple providers may significantly reduce fallback options and
  limit request recovery.
</Warning>

<Tip title="Account-Wide Ignored Providers">
  You can ignore providers for all account requests by configuring your [preferences](/settings/preferences). This configuration applies to all API requests and chatroom messages.

  Note that when you ignore providers for a specific request, the list of ignored providers is merged with your account-wide ignored providers.
</Tip>

### Example: Ignoring DeepInfra for a request calling Llama 3.3 70b

Here's an example that will ignore DeepInfra for a request calling Llama 3.3 70b:

<TSFetchCodeBlock
  uriPath="/api/v1/chat/completions"
  body={{
    model: 'meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    provider: {
      ignore: ['deepinfra'],
    },
  }}
/>

## Quantization

Quantization reduces model size and computational requirements while aiming to preserve performance. Most LLMs today use FP16 or BF16 for training and inference, cutting memory requirements in half compared to FP32. Some optimizations use FP8 or quantization to reduce size further (e.g., INT8, INT4).

| Field           | Type      | Default | Description                                                                                     |
| --------------- | --------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `quantizations` | string\[] | -       | List of quantization levels to filter by (e.g. `["int4", "int8"]`). [Learn more](#quantization) |

<Warning>
  Quantized models may exhibit degraded performance for certain prompts,
  depending on the method used.
</Warning>

Providers can support various quantization levels for open-weight models.

### Quantization Levels

By default, requests are load-balanced across all available providers, ordered by price. To filter providers by quantization level, specify the `quantizations` field in the `provider` parameter with the following values:

* `int4`: Integer (4 bit)
* `int8`: Integer (8 bit)
* `fp4`: Floating point (4 bit)
* `fp6`: Floating point (6 bit)
* `fp8`: Floating point (8 bit)
* `fp16`: Floating point (16 bit)
* `bf16`: Brain floating point (16 bit)
* `fp32`: Floating point (32 bit)
* `unknown`: Unknown

### Example: Requesting FP8 Quantization

Here's an example that will only use providers that support FP8 quantization:

<TSFetchCodeBlock
  uriPath="/api/v1/chat/completions"
  body={{
    model: 'meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
    provider: {
      quantizations: ['fp8'],
    },
  }}
/>

### Max Price

To filter providers by price, specify the `max_price` field in the `provider` parameter with a JSON object specifying the highest provider pricing you will accept.

For example, the value `{"prompt": 1, "completion": 2}` will route to any provider with a price of `<= $1/m` prompt tokens, and `<= $2/m` completion tokens or less.

Some providers support per request pricing, in which case you can use the `request` attribute of max\_price. Lastly, `image` is also available, which specifies the max price per image you will accept.

Practically, this field is often combined with a provider `sort` to express, for example, "Use the provider with the highest throughput, as long as it doesn't cost more than `$x/m` tokens."

## Terms of Service

You can view the terms of service for each provider below. You may not violate the terms of service or policies of third-party providers that power the models on OpenRouter.

# Latency and Performance

> Learn about OpenRouter's performance characteristics, latency optimizations, and best practices for achieving optimal response times.

OpenRouter is designed with performance as a top priority. OpenRouter is heavily optimized to add as little latency as possible to your requests.

## Base Latency

Under typical production conditions, OpenRouter adds approximately 40ms of latency to your requests. This minimal overhead is achieved through:

* Edge computing using Cloudflare Workers to stay as close as possible to your application
* Efficient caching of user and API key data at the edge
* Optimized routing logic that minimizes processing time

## Performance Considerations

### Cache Warming

When OpenRouter's edge caches are cold (typically during the first 1-2 minutes of operation in a new region), you may experience slightly higher latency as the caches warm up. This normalizes once the caches are populated.

### Credit Balance Checks

To maintain accurate billing and prevent overages, OpenRouter performs additional database checks when:

* A user's credit balance is low (single digit dollars)
* An API key is approaching its configured credit limit

OpenRouter expires caches more aggressively under these conditions to ensure proper billing, which increases latency until additional credits are added.

### Model Fallback

When using [model routing](/docs/features/model-routing) or [provider routing](/docs/features/provider-routing), if the primary model or provider fails, OpenRouter will automatically try the next option. A failed initial completion unsurprisingly adds latency to the specific request. OpenRouter tracks provider failures, and will attempt to intelligently route around unavailable providers so that this latency is not incurred on every request.

## Best Practices

To achieve optimal performance with OpenRouter:

1. **Maintain Healthy Credit Balance**
   * Set up auto-topup with a higher threshold and amount
   * This helps avoid forced credit checks and reduces the risk of hitting zero balance
   * Recommended minimum balance: \$10-20 to ensure smooth operation

2. **Use Provider Preferences**
   * If you have specific latency requirements (whether time to first token, or time to last), there are [provider routing](/docs/features/provider-routing) features to help you achieve your performance and cost goals.

<!-- ===== BEGIN https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/presets.mdx ===== -->
# Presets

> Learn how to use OpenRouter's presets to manage model configurations, system prompts, and parameters across your applications.

[Presets](/settings/presets) allow you to separate your LLM configuration from your code. Create and manage presets through the OpenRouter web application to control provider routing, model selection, system prompts, and other parameters, then reference them in OpenRouter API requests.

## What are Presets?

Presets are named configurations that encapsulate all the settings needed for a specific use case. For example, you might create:

* An "email-copywriter" preset for generating marketing copy
* An "inbound-classifier" preset for categorizing customer inquiries
* A "code-reviewer" preset for analyzing pull requests

Each preset can manage:

* Provider routing preferences (sort by price, latency, etc.)
* Model selection (specific model or array of models with fallbacks)
* System prompts
* Generation parameters (temperature, top\_p, etc.)
* Provider inclusion/exclusion rules

## Quick Start

1. [Create a preset](/settings/presets). For example, select a model and restrict provider routing to just a few providers.
   ![Creating a new preset](file:ebc1875f-7940-454d-af04-4e32faf82031 "A new preset")

2. Make an API request to the preset:

```json
{
  "model": "@preset/ravenel-bridge",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What's your opinion of the Golden Gate Bridge? Isn't it beautiful?"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Benefits

### Separation of Concerns

Presets help you maintain a clean separation between your application code and LLM configuration. This makes your code more semantic and easier to maintain.

### Rapid Iteration

Update your LLM configuration without deploying code changes:

* Switch to new model versions
* Adjust system prompts
* Modify parameters
* Change provider preferences

## Using Presets

There are three ways to use presets in your API requests.

1. **Direct Model Reference**

You can reference the preset as if it was a model by sending requests to `@preset/preset-slug`

```json
{
  "model": "@preset/email-copywriter",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Write a marketing email about our new feature"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. **Preset Field**

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4",
  "preset": "email-copywriter",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Write a marketing email about our new feature"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. **Combined Model and Preset**

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4@preset/email-copywriter",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Write a marketing email about our new feature"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Other Notes

1. If you're using an organization account, all members can access organization presets. This is a great way to share best practices across teams.
2. Version history is kept in order to understand changes that were made, and to be able to roll back. However when addressing a preset through the API, the latest version is always used.
3. If you provide parameters in the request, they will be shallow-merged with the options configured in the preset.

# Prompt Caching

> Reduce your AI model costs with OpenRouter's prompt caching feature. Learn how to cache and reuse responses across OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, and DeepSeek models.

To save on inference costs, you can enable prompt caching on supported providers and models.

Most providers automatically enable prompt caching, but note that some (see Anthropic below) require you to enable it on a per-message basis.

When using caching (whether automatically in supported models, or via the `cache_control` property), OpenRouter will make a best-effort to continue routing to the same provider to make use of the warm cache. In the event that the provider with your cached prompt is not available, OpenRouter will try the next-best provider.

## Inspecting cache usage

To see how much caching saved on each generation, you can:

1. Click the detail button on the [Activity](/activity) page
2. Use the `/api/v1/generation` API, [documented here](/api-reference/overview#querying-cost-and-stats)
3. Use `usage: {include: true}` in your request to get the cache tokens at the end of the response (see [Usage Accounting](/use-cases/usage-accounting) for details)

The `cache_discount` field in the response body will tell you how much the response saved on cache usage. Some providers, like Anthropic, will have a negative discount on cache writes, but a positive discount (which reduces total cost) on cache reads.

## OpenAI

Caching price changes:

* **Cache writes**: no cost
* **Cache reads**: (depending on the model) charged at 0.25x or 0.50x the price of the original input pricing

[Click here to view OpenAI's cache pricing per model.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing)

Prompt caching with OpenAI is automated and does not require any additional configuration. There is a minimum prompt size of 1024 tokens.

[Click here to read more about OpenAI prompt caching and its limitation.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-caching)

## Grok

Caching price changes:

* **Cache writes**: no cost
* **Cache reads**: charged at {GROK_CACHE_READ_MULTIPLIER}x the price of the original input pricing

[Click here to view Grok's cache pricing per model.](https://docs.x.ai/docs/models#models-and-pricing)

Prompt caching with Grok is automated and does not require any additional configuration.

## Moonshot AI

Caching price changes:

* **Cache writes**: no cost
* **Cache reads**: charged at {MOONSHOT_CACHE_READ_MULTIPLIER}x the price of the original input pricing

Prompt caching with Moonshot AI is automated and does not require any additional configuration.

[Click here to view Moonshot AI's caching documentation.](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/api/caching)

## Groq

Caching price changes:

* **Cache writes**: no cost
* **Cache reads**: charged at {GROQ_CACHE_READ_MULTIPLIER}x the price of the original input pricing

Prompt caching with Groq is automated and does not require any additional configuration. Currently available on Kimi K2 models.

[Click here to view Groq's documentation.](https://console.groq.com/docs/prompt-caching)

## Anthropic Claude

Caching price changes:

* **Cache writes**: charged at {ANTHROPIC_CACHE_WRITE_MULTIPLIER}x the price of the original input pricing
* **Cache reads**: charged at {ANTHROPIC_CACHE_READ_MULTIPLIER}x the price of the original input pricing

Prompt caching with Anthropic requires the use of `cache_control` breakpoints. There is a limit of four breakpoints, and the cache will expire within five minutes. Therefore, it is recommended to reserve the cache breakpoints for large bodies of text, such as character cards, CSV data, RAG data, book chapters, etc.

[Click here to read more about Anthropic prompt caching and its limitation.](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching)

The `cache_control` breakpoint can only be inserted into the text part of a multipart message.

System message caching example:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "You are a historian studying the fall of the Roman Empire. You know the following book very well:"
        },
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "HUGE TEXT BODY",
          "cache_control": {
            "type": "ephemeral"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "What triggered the collapse?"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

User message caching example:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Given the book below:"
        },
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "HUGE TEXT BODY",
          "cache_control": {
            "type": "ephemeral"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Name all the characters in the above book"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## DeepSeek

Caching price changes:

* **Cache writes**: charged at the same price as the original input pricing
* **Cache reads**: charged at {DEEPSEEK_CACHE_READ_MULTIPLIER}x the price of the original input pricing

Prompt caching with DeepSeek is automated and does not require any additional configuration.

## Google Gemini

### Implicit Caching

Gemini 2.5 Pro and 2.5 Flash models now support **implicit caching**, providing automatic caching functionality similar to OpenAI’s automatic caching. Implicit caching works seamlessly — no manual setup or additional `cache_control` breakpoints required.

Pricing Changes:

* No cache write or storage costs.
* Cached tokens are charged at {GOOGLE_CACHE_READ_MULTIPLIER}x the original input token cost.

Note that the TTL is on average 3-5 minutes, but will vary. There is a minimum of {GOOGLE_CACHE_MIN_TOKENS_2_5_FLASH} tokens for Gemini 2.5 Flash, and {GOOGLE_CACHE_MIN_TOKENS_2_5_PRO} tokens for Gemini 2.5 Pro for requests to be eligible for caching.

[Official announcement from Google](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-2-5-models-now-support-implicit-caching/)

<Tip>
  To maximize implicit cache hits, keep the initial portion of your message
  arrays consistent between requests. Push variations (such as user questions or
  dynamic context elements) toward the end of your prompt/requests.
</Tip>

### Pricing Changes for Cached Requests:

* **Cache Writes:** Charged at the input token cost plus 5 minutes of cache storage, calculated as follows:

```
Cache write cost = Input token price + (Cache storage price × (5 minutes / 60 minutes))
```

* **Cache Reads:** Charged at {GOOGLE_CACHE_READ_MULTIPLIER}× the original input token cost.

### Supported Models and Limitations:

Only certain Gemini models support caching. Please consult Google's [Gemini API Pricing Documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing) for the most current details.

Cache Writes have a 5 minute Time-to-Live (TTL) that does not update. After 5 minutes, the cache expires and a new cache must be written.

Gemini models have typically have a 4096 token minimum for cache write to occur. Cached tokens count towards the model's maximum token usage. Gemini 2.5 Pro has a minimum of {GOOGLE_CACHE_MIN_TOKENS_2_5_PRO} tokens, and Gemini 2.5 Flash has a minimum of {GOOGLE_CACHE_MIN_TOKENS_2_5_FLASH} tokens.

### How Gemini Prompt Caching works on OpenRouter:

OpenRouter simplifies Gemini cache management, abstracting away complexities:

* You **do not** need to manually create, update, or delete caches.
* You **do not** need to manage cache names or TTL explicitly.

### How to Enable Gemini Prompt Caching:

Gemini caching in OpenRouter requires you to insert `cache_control` breakpoints explicitly within message content, similar to Anthropic. We recommend using caching primarily for large content pieces (such as CSV files, lengthy character cards, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) data, or extensive textual sources).

<Tip>
  There is not a limit on the number of `cache_control` breakpoints you can
  include in your request. OpenRouter will use only the last breakpoint for
  Gemini caching. Including multiple breakpoints is safe and can help maintain
  compatibility with Anthropic, but only the final one will be used for Gemini.
</Tip>

### Examples:

#### System Message Caching Example

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "You are a historian studying the fall of the Roman Empire. Below is an extensive reference book:"
        },
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "HUGE TEXT BODY HERE",
          "cache_control": {
            "type": "ephemeral"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "What triggered the collapse?"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### User Message Caching Example

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Based on the book text below:"
        },
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "HUGE TEXT BODY HERE",
          "cache_control": {
            "type": "ephemeral"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "List all main characters mentioned in the text above."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

# Structured Outputs

> Enforce JSON Schema validation on AI model responses. Get consistent, type-safe outputs and avoid parsing errors with OpenRouter's structured output feature.

OpenRouter supports structured outputs for compatible models, ensuring responses follow a specific JSON Schema format. This feature is particularly useful when you need consistent, well-formatted responses that can be reliably parsed by your application.

## Overview

Structured outputs allow you to:

* Enforce specific JSON Schema validation on model responses
* Get consistent, type-safe outputs
* Avoid parsing errors and hallucinated fields
* Simplify response handling in your application

## Using Structured Outputs

To use structured outputs, include a `response_format` parameter in your request, with `type` set to `json_schema` and the `json_schema` object containing your schema:

```typescript
{
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in London?" }
  ],
  "response_format": {
    "type": "json_schema",
    "json_schema": {
      "name": "weather",
      "strict": true,
      "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "location": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "City or location name"
          },
          "temperature": {
            "type": "number",
            "description": "Temperature in Celsius"
          },
          "conditions": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Weather conditions description"
          }
        },
        "required": ["location", "temperature", "conditions"],
        "additionalProperties": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The model will respond with a JSON object that strictly follows your schema:

```json
{
  "location": "London",
  "temperature": 18,
  "conditions": "Partly cloudy with light drizzle"
}
```

## Model Support

Structured outputs are supported by select models.

You can find a list of models that support structured outputs on the [models page](https://openrouter.ai/models?order=newest\&supported_parameters=structured_outputs).

* OpenAI models (GPT-4o and later versions) [Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs)
* All Fireworks provided models [Docs](https://docs.fireworks.ai/structured-responses/structured-response-formatting#structured-response-modes)

To ensure your chosen model supports structured outputs:

1. Check the model's supported parameters on the [models page](https://openrouter.ai/models)
2. Set `require_parameters: true` in your provider preferences (see [Provider Routing](/docs/features/provider-routing))
3. Include `response_format` and set `type: json_schema` in the required parameters

## Best Practices

1. **Include descriptions**: Add clear descriptions to your schema properties to guide the model

2. **Use strict mode**: Always set `strict: true` to ensure the model follows your schema exactly

## Example Implementation

Here's a complete example using the Fetch API:

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'openai/gpt-4'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript title="With TypeScript"
    const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: 'Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        messages: [
          { role: 'user', content: 'What is the weather like in London?' },
        ],
        response_format: {
          type: 'json_schema',
          json_schema: {
            name: 'weather',
            strict: true,
            schema: {
              type: 'object',
              properties: {
                location: {
                  type: 'string',
                  description: 'City or location name',
                },
                temperature: {
                  type: 'number',
                  description: 'Temperature in Celsius',
                },
                conditions: {
                  type: 'string',
                  description: 'Weather conditions description',
                },
              },
              required: ['location', 'temperature', 'conditions'],
              additionalProperties: false,
            },
          },
        },
      }),
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    const weatherInfo = data.choices[0].message.content;
    ```

    ```python title="With Python"
    import requests
    import json

    response = requests.post(
      "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions",
      headers={
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },

      json={
        "model": "{{MODEL}}",
        "messages": [
          {"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather like in London?"},
        ],
        "response_format": {
          "type": "json_schema",
          "json_schema": {
            "name": "weather",
            "strict": True,
            "schema": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                "location": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "description": "City or location name",
                },
                "temperature": {
                  "type": "number",
                  "description": "Temperature in Celsius",
                },
                "conditions": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "description": "Weather conditions description",
                },
              },
              "required": ["location", "temperature", "conditions"],
              "additionalProperties": False,
            },
          },
        },
      },
    )

    data = response.json()
    weather_info = data["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

## Streaming with Structured Outputs

Structured outputs are also supported with streaming responses. The model will stream valid partial JSON that, when complete, forms a valid response matching your schema.

To enable streaming with structured outputs, simply add `stream: true` to your request:

```typescript
{
  "stream": true,
  "response_format": {
    "type": "json_schema",
    // ... rest of your schema
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

When using structured outputs, you may encounter these scenarios:

1. **Model doesn't support structured outputs**: The request will fail with an error indicating lack of support
2. **Invalid schema**: The model will return an error if your JSON Schema is invalid

# Tool & Function Calling

> Use tools (or functions) in your prompts with OpenRouter. Learn how to use tools with OpenAI, Anthropic, and other models that support tool calling.

Tool calls (also known as function calls) give an LLM access to external tools. The LLM does not call the tools directly. Instead, it suggests the tool to call. The user then calls the tool separately and provides the results back to the LLM. Finally, the LLM formats the response into an answer to the user's original question.

OpenRouter standardizes the tool calling interface across models and providers, making it easy to integrate external tools with any supported model.

**Supported Models**: You can find models that support tool calling by filtering on [openrouter.ai/models?supported\_parameters=tools](https://openrouter.ai/models?supported_parameters=tools).

If you prefer to learn from a full end-to-end example, keep reading.

## Request Body Examples

Tool calling with OpenRouter involves three key steps. Here are the essential request body formats for each step:

### Step 1: Inference Request with Tools

```json
{
  "model": "google/gemini-2.0-flash-001",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What are the titles of some James Joyce books?"
    }
  ],
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "search_gutenberg_books",
        "description": "Search for books in the Project Gutenberg library",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "search_terms": {
              "type": "array",
              "items": {"type": "string"},
              "description": "List of search terms to find books"
            }
          },
          "required": ["search_terms"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Tool Execution (Client-Side)

After receiving the model's response with `tool_calls`, execute the requested tool locally and prepare the result:

```javascript
// Model responds with tool_calls, you execute the tool locally
const toolResult = await searchGutenbergBooks(["James", "Joyce"]);
```

### Step 3: Inference Request with Tool Results

```json
{
  "model": "google/gemini-2.0-flash-001",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What are the titles of some James Joyce books?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": null,
      "tool_calls": [
        {
          "id": "call_abc123",
          "type": "function",
          "function": {
            "name": "search_gutenberg_books",
            "arguments": "{\"search_terms\": [\"James\", \"Joyce\"]}"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "role": "tool",
      "tool_call_id": "call_abc123",
      "content": "[{\"id\": 4300, \"title\": \"Ulysses\", \"authors\": [{\"name\": \"Joyce, James\"}]}]"
    }
  ],
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "search_gutenberg_books",
        "description": "Search for books in the Project Gutenberg library",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "search_terms": {
              "type": "array",
              "items": {"type": "string"},
              "description": "List of search terms to find books"
            }
          },
          "required": ["search_terms"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note**: The `tools` parameter must be included in every request (Steps 1 and 3) so the router can validate the tool schema on each call.

### Tool Calling Example

Here is Python code that gives LLMs the ability to call an external API -- in this case Project Gutenberg, to search for books.

First, let's do some basic setup:

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python
    import json, requests
    from openai import OpenAI

    OPENROUTER_API_KEY = f"{{API_KEY_REF}}"

    # You can use any model that supports tool calling
    MODEL = "{{MODEL}}"

    openai_client = OpenAI(
      base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
      api_key=OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
    )

    task = "What are the titles of some James Joyce books?"

    messages = [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": task,
      }
    ]

    ```

    ```typescript
    const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        messages: [
          { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant.' },
          {
            role: 'user',
            content: 'What are the titles of some James Joyce books?',
          },
        ],
      }),
    });
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

### Define the Tool

Next, we define the tool that we want to call. Remember, the tool is going to get *requested* by the LLM, but the code we are writing here is ultimately responsible for executing the call and returning the results to the LLM.

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python
    def search_gutenberg_books(search_terms):
        search_query = " ".join(search_terms)
        url = "https://gutendex.com/books"
        response = requests.get(url, params={"search": search_query})

        simplified_results = []
        for book in response.json().get("results", []):
            simplified_results.append({
                "id": book.get("id"),
                "title": book.get("title"),
                "authors": book.get("authors")
            })

        return simplified_results

    tools = [
      {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
          "name": "search_gutenberg_books",
          "description": "Search for books in the Project Gutenberg library based on specified search terms",
          "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "search_terms": {
                "type": "array",
                "items": {
                  "type": "string"
                },
                "description": "List of search terms to find books in the Gutenberg library (e.g. ['dickens', 'great'] to search for books by Dickens with 'great' in the title)"
              }
            },
            "required": ["search_terms"]
          }
        }
      }
    ]

    TOOL_MAPPING = {
        "search_gutenberg_books": search_gutenberg_books
    }

    ```

    ```typescript
    async function searchGutenbergBooks(searchTerms: string[]): Promise<Book[]> {
      const searchQuery = searchTerms.join(' ');
      const url = 'https://gutendex.com/books';
      const response = await fetch(`${url}?search=${searchQuery}`);
      const data = await response.json();

      return data.results.map((book: any) => ({
        id: book.id,
        title: book.title,
        authors: book.authors,
      }));
    }

    const tools = [
      {
        type: 'function',
        function: {
          name: 'searchGutenbergBooks',
          description:
            'Search for books in the Project Gutenberg library based on specified search terms',
          parameters: {
            type: 'object',
            properties: {
              search_terms: {
                type: 'array',
                items: {
                  type: 'string',
                },
                description:
                  "List of search terms to find books in the Gutenberg library (e.g. ['dickens', 'great'] to search for books by Dickens with 'great' in the title)",
              },
            },
            required: ['search_terms'],
          },
        },
      },
    ];

    const TOOL_MAPPING = {
      searchGutenbergBooks,
    };
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

Note that the "tool" is just a normal function. We then write a JSON "spec" compatible with the OpenAI function calling parameter. We'll pass that spec to the LLM so that it knows this tool is available and how to use it. It will request the tool when needed, along with any arguments. We'll then marshal the tool call locally, make the function call, and return the results to the LLM.

### Tool use and tool results

Let's make the first OpenRouter API call to the model:

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python
    request_1 = {
        "model": {{MODEL}},
        "tools": tools,
        "messages": messages
    }

    response_1 = openai_client.chat.completions.create(**request_1).message
    ```

    ```typescript
    const request_1 = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        tools,
        messages,
      }),
    });

    const data = await request_1.json();
    const response_1 = data.choices[0].message;
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

The LLM responds with a finish reason of `tool_calls`, and a `tool_calls` array. In a generic LLM response-handler, you would want to check the `finish_reason` before processing tool calls, but here we will assume it's the case. Let's keep going, by processing the tool call:

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python
    # Append the response to the messages array so the LLM has the full context
    # It's easy to forget this step!
    messages.append(response_1)

    # Now we process the requested tool calls, and use our book lookup tool
    for tool_call in response_1.tool_calls:
        '''
        In this case we only provided one tool, so we know what function to call.
        When providing multiple tools, you can inspect `tool_call.function.name`
        to figure out what function you need to call locally.
        '''
        tool_name = tool_call.function.name
        tool_args = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)
        tool_response = TOOL_MAPPING[tool_name](**tool_args)
        messages.append({
          "role": "tool",
          "tool_call_id": tool_call.id,
          "content": json.dumps(tool_response),
        })
    ```

    ```typescript
    // Append the response to the messages array so the LLM has the full context
    // It's easy to forget this step!
    messages.push(response_1);

    // Now we process the requested tool calls, and use our book lookup tool
    for (const toolCall of response_1.tool_calls) {
      const toolName = toolCall.function.name;
      const { search_params } = JSON.parse(toolCall.function.arguments);
      const toolResponse = await TOOL_MAPPING[toolName](search_params);
      messages.push({
        role: 'tool',
        toolCallId: toolCall.id,
        name: toolName,
        content: JSON.stringify(toolResponse),
      });
    }
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

The messages array now has:

1. Our original request
2. The LLM's response (containing a tool call request)
3. The result of the tool call (a json object returned from the Project Gutenberg API)

Now, we can make a second OpenRouter API call, and hopefully get our result!

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python
    request_2 = {
      "model": MODEL,
      "messages": messages,
      "tools": tools
    }

    response_2 = openai_client.chat.completions.create(**request_2)

    print(response_2.choices[0].message.content)
    ```

    ```typescript
    const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        messages,
        tools,
      }),
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data.choices[0].message.content);
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

The output will be something like:

```text
Here are some books by James Joyce:

*   *Ulysses*
*   *Dubliners*
*   *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*
*   *Chamber Music*
*   *Exiles: A Play in Three Acts*
```

We did it! We've successfully used a tool in a prompt.

## Interleaved Thinking

Interleaved thinking allows models to reason between tool calls, enabling more sophisticated decision-making after receiving tool results. This feature helps models chain multiple tool calls with reasoning steps in between and make nuanced decisions based on intermediate results.

**Important**: Interleaved thinking increases token usage and response latency. Consider your budget and performance requirements when enabling this feature.

### How Interleaved Thinking Works

With interleaved thinking, the model can:

* Reason about the results of a tool call before deciding what to do next
* Chain multiple tool calls with reasoning steps in between
* Make more nuanced decisions based on intermediate results
* Provide transparent reasoning for its tool selection process

### Example: Multi-Step Research with Reasoning

Here's an example showing how a model might use interleaved thinking to research a topic across multiple sources:

**Initial Request:**

```json
{
  "model": "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Research the environmental impact of electric vehicles and provide a comprehensive analysis."
    }
  ],
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "search_academic_papers",
        "description": "Search for academic papers on a given topic",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "query": {"type": "string"},
            "field": {"type": "string"}
          },
          "required": ["query"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "get_latest_statistics",
        "description": "Get latest statistics on a topic",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "topic": {"type": "string"},
            "year": {"type": "integer"}
          },
          "required": ["topic"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Model's Reasoning and Tool Calls:**

1. **Initial Thinking**: "I need to research electric vehicle environmental impact. Let me start with academic papers to get peer-reviewed research."

2. **First Tool Call**: `search_academic_papers({"query": "electric vehicle lifecycle environmental impact", "field": "environmental science"})`

3. **After First Tool Result**: "The papers show mixed results on manufacturing impact. I need current statistics to complement this academic research."

4. **Second Tool Call**: `get_latest_statistics({"topic": "electric vehicle carbon footprint", "year": 2024})`

5. **After Second Tool Result**: "Now I have both academic research and current data. Let me search for manufacturing-specific studies to address the gaps I found."

6. **Third Tool Call**: `search_academic_papers({"query": "electric vehicle battery manufacturing environmental cost", "field": "materials science"})`

7. **Final Analysis**: Synthesizes all gathered information into a comprehensive response.

### Best Practices for Interleaved Thinking

* **Clear Tool Descriptions**: Provide detailed descriptions so the model can reason about when to use each tool
* **Structured Parameters**: Use well-defined parameter schemas to help the model make precise tool calls
* **Context Preservation**: Maintain conversation context across multiple tool interactions
* **Error Handling**: Design tools to provide meaningful error messages that help the model adjust its approach

### Implementation Considerations

When implementing interleaved thinking:

* Models may take longer to respond due to additional reasoning steps
* Token usage will be higher due to the reasoning process
* The quality of reasoning depends on the model's capabilities
* Some models may be better suited for this approach than others

## A Simple Agentic Loop

In the example above, the calls are made explicitly and sequentially. To handle a wide variety of user inputs and tool calls, you can use an agentic loop.

Here's an example of a simple agentic loop (using the same `tools` and initial `messages` as above):

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python

    def call_llm(msgs):
        resp = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
            model={{MODEL}},
            tools=tools,
            messages=msgs
        )
        msgs.append(resp.choices[0].message.dict())
        return resp

    def get_tool_response(response):
        tool_call = response.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0]
        tool_name = tool_call.function.name
        tool_args = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)

        # Look up the correct tool locally, and call it with the provided arguments
        # Other tools can be added without changing the agentic loop
        tool_result = TOOL_MAPPING[tool_name](**tool_args)

        return {
            "role": "tool",
            "tool_call_id": tool_call.id,
            "content": tool_result,
        }

    max_iterations = 10
    iteration_count = 0

    while iteration_count < max_iterations:
        iteration_count += 1
        resp = call_llm(_messages)

        if resp.choices[0].message.tool_calls is not None:
            messages.append(get_tool_response(resp))
        else:
            break

    if iteration_count >= max_iterations:
        print("Warning: Maximum iterations reached")

    print(messages[-1]['content'])

    ```

    ```typescript
    async function callLLM(messages: Message[]): Promise<Message> {
      const response = await fetch(
        'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions',
        {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: {
            Authorization: `Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}`,
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          },
          body: JSON.stringify({
            model: '{{MODEL}}',
            tools,
            messages,
          }),
        },
      );

      const data = await response.json();
      messages.push(data.choices[0].message);
      return data;
    }

    async function getToolResponse(response: Message): Promise<Message> {
      const toolCall = response.toolCalls[0];
      const toolName = toolCall.function.name;
      const toolArgs = JSON.parse(toolCall.function.arguments);

      // Look up the correct tool locally, and call it with the provided arguments
      // Other tools can be added without changing the agentic loop
      const toolResult = await TOOL_MAPPING[toolName](toolArgs);

      return {
        role: 'tool',
        toolCallId: toolCall.id,
        content: toolResult,
      };
    }

    const maxIterations = 10;
    let iterationCount = 0;

    while (iterationCount < maxIterations) {
      iterationCount++;
      const response = await callLLM(messages);

      if (response.toolCalls) {
        messages.push(await getToolResponse(response));
      } else {
        break;
      }
    }

    if (iterationCount >= maxIterations) {
      console.warn("Warning: Maximum iterations reached");
    }

    console.log(messages[messages.length - 1].content);
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

## Best Practices and Advanced Patterns

### Function Definition Guidelines

When defining tools for LLMs, follow these best practices:

**Clear and Descriptive Names**: Use descriptive function names that clearly indicate the tool's purpose.

```json
// Good: Clear and specific
{ "name": "get_weather_forecast" }
```

```json
// Avoid: Too vague
{ "name": "weather" }
```

**Comprehensive Descriptions**: Provide detailed descriptions that help the model understand when and how to use the tool.

```json
{
  "description": "Get current weather conditions and 5-day forecast for a specific location. Supports cities, zip codes, and coordinates.",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "location": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "City name, zip code, or coordinates (lat,lng). Examples: 'New York', '10001', '40.7128,-74.0060'"
      },
      "units": {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
        "description": "Temperature unit preference",
        "default": "celsius"
      }
    },
    "required": ["location"]
  }
}
```

### Streaming with Tool Calls

When using streaming responses with tool calls, handle the different content types appropriately:

```typescript
const stream = await fetch('/api/chat/completions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet',
    messages: messages,
    tools: tools,
    stream: true
  })
});

const reader = stream.body.getReader();
let toolCalls = [];

while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read();
  if (done) {
    break;
  }

  const chunk = new TextDecoder().decode(value);
  const lines = chunk.split('\n').filter(line => line.trim());

  for (const line of lines) {
    if (line.startsWith('data: ')) {
      const data = JSON.parse(line.slice(6));

      if (data.choices[0].delta.tool_calls) {
        toolCalls.push(...data.choices[0].delta.tool_calls);
      }

      if (data.choices[0].delta.finish_reason === 'tool_calls') {
        await handleToolCalls(toolCalls);
      } else if (data.choices[0].delta.finish_reason === 'stop') {
        // Regular completion without tool calls
        break;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Tool Choice Configuration

Control tool usage with the `tool_choice` parameter:

```json
// Let model decide (default)
{ "tool_choice": "auto" }
```

```json
// Disable tool usage
{ "tool_choice": "none" }
```

```json
// Force specific tool
{
  "tool_choice": {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {"name": "search_database"}
  }
}
```

### Parallel Tool Calls

Control whether multiple tools can be called simultaneously with the `parallel_tool_calls` parameter (default is true for most models):

```json
// Disable parallel tool calls - tools will be called sequentially
{ "parallel_tool_calls": false }
```

When `parallel_tool_calls` is `false`, the model will only request one tool call at a time instead of potentially multiple calls in parallel.

### Multi-Tool Workflows

Design tools that work well together:

```json
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "search_products",
        "description": "Search for products in the catalog"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "get_product_details",
        "description": "Get detailed information about a specific product"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "check_inventory",
        "description": "Check current inventory levels for a product"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This allows the model to naturally chain operations: search → get details → check inventory.

# Multimodal Capabilities

> Send images, PDFs, and audio to OpenRouter models through our unified API.

OpenRouter supports multiple input modalities beyond text, allowing you to send images, PDFs, and audio files to compatible models through our unified API. This enables rich multimodal interactions for a wide variety of use cases.

## Supported Modalities

### Images

Send images to vision-capable models for analysis, description, OCR, and more. OpenRouter supports multiple image formats and both URL-based and base64-encoded images.

[Learn more about image inputs →](/docs/features/multimodal/images)

### Image Generation

Generate images from text prompts using AI models with image output capabilities. OpenRouter supports various image generation models that can create high-quality images based on your descriptions.

[Learn more about image generation →](/docs/features/multimodal/image-generation)

### PDFs

Process PDF documents with any model on OpenRouter. Our intelligent PDF parsing system extracts text and handles both text-based and scanned documents.

[Learn more about PDF processing →](/docs/features/multimodal/pdfs)

### Audio

Send audio files to speech-capable models for transcription, analysis, and processing. OpenRouter supports common audio formats with automatic routing to compatible models.

[Learn more about audio inputs →](/docs/features/multimodal/audio)

## Getting Started

All multimodal inputs use the same `/api/v1/chat/completions` endpoint with the `messages` parameter. Different content types are specified in the message content array:

* **Images**: Use `image_url` content type
* **PDFs**: Use `file` content type with PDF data
* **Audio**: Use `input_audio` content type

You can combine multiple modalities in a single request, and the number of files you can send varies by provider and model.

## Model Compatibility

Not all models support every modality. OpenRouter automatically filters available models based on your request content:

* **Vision models**: Required for image processing
* **File-compatible models**: Can process PDFs natively or through our parsing system
* **Audio-capable models**: Required for audio input processing

Use our [Models page](https://openrouter.ai/models) to find models that support your desired input modalities.

## Input Format Support

OpenRouter supports both **direct URLs** and **base64-encoded data** for multimodal inputs:

### URLs (Recommended for public content)

* **Images**: `https://example.com/image.jpg`
* **PDFs**: `https://example.com/document.pdf`
* **Audio**: Not supported via URL (base64 only)

### Base64 Encoding (Required for local files)

* **Images**: `data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_data}`
* **PDFs**: `data:application/pdf;base64,{base64_data}`
* **Audio**: Raw base64 string with format specification

<Info>
  URLs are more efficient for large files as they don't require local encoding and reduce request payload size. Base64 encoding is required for local files or when the content is not publicly accessible.
</Info>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I mix different modalities in one request?">
    Yes! You can send text, images, PDFs, and audio in the same request. The model will process all inputs together.

# Image Inputs

> Send images to vision models through the OpenRouter API.

Requests with images, to multimodel models, are available via the `/api/v1/chat/completions` API with a multi-part `messages` parameter. The `image_url` can either be a URL or a base64-encoded image. Note that multiple images can be sent in separate content array entries. The number of images you can send in a single request varies per provider and per model. Due to how the content is parsed, we recommend sending the text prompt first, then the images. If the images must come first, we recommend putting it in the system prompt.

OpenRouter supports both **direct URLs** and **base64-encoded data** for images:

* **URLs**: More efficient for publicly accessible images as they don't require local encoding
* **Base64**: Required for local files or private images that aren't publicly accessible

### Using Image URLs

Here's how to send an image using a URL:

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python
    import requests
    import json

    url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY_REF}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    messages = [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "What's in this image?"
                },
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]

    payload = {
        "model": "{{MODEL}}",
        "messages": messages
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    print(response.json())
    ```

    ```typescript
    const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY_REF}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        messages: [
          {
            role: 'user',
            content: [
              {
                type: 'text',
                text: "What's in this image?",
              },
              {
                type: 'image_url',
                image_url: {
                  url: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg',
                },
              },
            ],
          },
        ],
      }),
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

### Using Base64 Encoded Images

For locally stored images, you can send them using base64 encoding. Here's how to do it:

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python
    import requests
    import json
    import base64
    from pathlib import Path

    def encode_image_to_base64(image_path):
        with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
            return base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')

    url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY_REF}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    # Read and encode the image
    image_path = "path/to/your/image.jpg"
    base64_image = encode_image_to_base64(image_path)
    data_url = f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_image}"

    messages = [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "What's in this image?"
                },
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": data_url
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]

    payload = {
        "model": "{{MODEL}}",
        "messages": messages
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    print(response.json())
    ```

    ```typescript
    async function encodeImageToBase64(imagePath: string): Promise<string> {
      const imageBuffer = await fs.promises.readFile(imagePath);
      const base64Image = imageBuffer.toString('base64');
      return `data:image/jpeg;base64,${base64Image}`;
    }

    // Read and encode the image
    const imagePath = 'path/to/your/image.jpg';
    const base64Image = await encodeImageToBase64(imagePath);

    const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY_REF}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        messages: [
          {
            role: 'user',
            content: [
              {
                type: 'text',
                text: "What's in this image?",
              },
              {
                type: 'image_url',
                image_url: {
                  url: base64Image,
                },
              },
            ],
          },
        ],
      }),
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

Supported image content types are:

* `image/png`
* `image/jpeg`
* `image/webp`
* `image/gif`

# Image Generation

> Generate images using AI models through the OpenRouter API.

OpenRouter supports image generation through models that have `"image"` in their `output_modalities`. These models can create images from text prompts when you specify the appropriate modalities in your request.

## Model Discovery

You can find image generation models in several ways:

### On the Models Page

Visit the [Models page](/models) and filter by output modalities to find models capable of image generation. Look for models that list `"image"` in their output modalities.

### In the Chatroom

When using the [Chatroom](/chat), click the **Image** button to automatically filter and select models with image generation capabilities. If no image-capable model is active, you'll be prompted to add one.

## API Usage

To generate images, send a request to the `/api/v1/chat/completions` endpoint with the `modalities` parameter set to include both `"image"` and `"text"`.

### Basic Image Generation

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'google/gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python
    import requests
    import json

    url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY_REF}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    payload = {
        "model": "{{MODEL}}",
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Generate a beautiful sunset over mountains"
            }
        ],
        "modalities": ["image", "text"]
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    result = response.json()

    # The generated image will be in the assistant message
    if result.get("choices"):
        message = result["choices"][0]["message"]
        if message.get("images"):
            for image in message["images"]:
                image_url = image["image_url"]["url"]  # Base64 data URL
                print(f"Generated image: {image_url[:50]}...")
    ```

    ```typescript
    const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY_REF}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        messages: [
          {
            role: 'user',
            content: 'Generate a beautiful sunset over mountains',
          },
        ],
        modalities: ['image', 'text'],
      }),
    });

    const result = await response.json();

    // The generated image will be in the assistant message
    if (result.choices) {
      const message = result.choices[0].message;
      if (message.images) {
        message.images.forEach((image, index) => {
          const imageUrl = image.image_url.url; // Base64 data URL
          console.log(`Generated image ${index + 1}: ${imageUrl.substring(0, 50)}...`);
        });
      }
    }
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

### Streaming Image Generation

Image generation also works with streaming responses:

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'google/gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python
    import requests
    import json

    url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY_REF}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    payload = {
        "model": "{{MODEL}}",
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Create an image of a futuristic city"
            }
        ],
        "modalities": ["image", "text"],
        "stream": True
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload, stream=True)

    for line in response.iter_lines():
        if line:
            line = line.decode('utf-8')
            if line.startswith('data: '):
                data = line[6:]
                if data != '[DONE]':
                    try:
                        chunk = json.loads(data)
                        if chunk.get("choices"):
                            delta = chunk["choices"][0].get("delta", {})
                            if delta.get("images"):
                                for image in delta["images"]:
                                    print(f"Generated image: {image['image_url']['url'][:50]}...")
                    except json.JSONDecodeError:
                        continue
    ```

    ```typescript
    const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY_REF}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        messages: [
          {
            role: 'user',
            content: 'Create an image of a futuristic city',
          },
        ],
        modalities: ['image', 'text'],
        stream: true,
      }),
    });

    const reader = response.body?.getReader();
    const decoder = new TextDecoder();

    while (true) {
      const { done, value } = await reader.read();
      if (done) break;
      
      const chunk = decoder.decode(value);
      const lines = chunk.split('\n');
      
      for (const line of lines) {
        if (line.startsWith('data: ')) {
          const data = line.slice(6);
          if (data !== '[DONE]') {
            try {
              const parsed = JSON.parse(data);
              if (parsed.choices) {
                const delta = parsed.choices[0].delta;
                if (delta?.images) {
                  delta.images.forEach((image, index) => {
                    console.log(`Generated image ${index + 1}: ${image.image_url.url.substring(0, 50)}...`);
                  });
                }
              }
            } catch (e) {
              // Skip invalid JSON
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

## Response Format

When generating images, the assistant message includes an `images` field containing the generated images:

```json
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "I've generated a beautiful sunset image for you.",
        "images": [
          {
            "type": "image_url",
            "image_url": {
              "url": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Image Format

* **Format**: Images are returned as base64-encoded data URLs
* **Types**: Typically PNG format (`data:image/png;base64,`)
* **Multiple Images**: Some models can generate multiple images in a single response
* **Size**: Image dimensions vary by model capabilities

## Model Compatibility

Not all models support image generation. To use this feature:

1. **Check Output Modalities**: Ensure the model has `"image"` in its `output_modalities`
2. **Set Modalities Parameter**: Include `"modalities": ["image", "text"]` in your request
3. **Use Compatible Models**: Examples include:
   * `google/gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`
   * Other models with image generation capabilities

## Best Practices

* **Clear Prompts**: Provide detailed descriptions for better image quality
* **Model Selection**: Choose models specifically designed for image generation
* **Error Handling**: Check for the `images` field in responses before processing
* **Rate Limits**: Image generation may have different rate limits than text generation
* **Storage**: Consider how you'll handle and store the base64 image data

## Troubleshooting

**No images in response?**

* Verify the model supports image generation (`output_modalities` includes `"image"`)
* Ensure you've included `"modalities": ["image", "text"]` in your request
* Check that your prompt is requesting image generation

**Model not found?**

* Use the [Models page](/models) to find available image generation models
* Filter by output modalities to see compatible models

# PDF Inputs

> Send PDF documents to any model on OpenRouter.

OpenRouter supports PDF processing through the `/api/v1/chat/completions` API. PDFs can be sent as **direct URLs** or **base64-encoded data URLs** in the messages array, via the file content type. This feature works on **any** model on OpenRouter.

**URL support**: Send publicly accessible PDFs directly without downloading or encoding\
**Base64 support**: Required for local files or private documents that aren't publicly accessible

PDFs also work in the chat room for interactive testing.

<Info>
  When a model supports file input natively, the PDF is passed directly to the
  model. When the model does not support file input natively, OpenRouter will
  parse the file and pass the parsed results to the requested model.
</Info>

<Tip>
  You can send both PDFs and other file types in the same request.
</Tip>

## Plugin Configuration

To configure PDF processing, use the `plugins` parameter in your request. OpenRouter provides several PDF processing engines with different capabilities and pricing:

```typescript
{
  plugins: [
    {
      id: 'file-parser',
      pdf: {
        engine: 'pdf-text', // or 'mistral-ocr' or 'native'
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

## Pricing

OpenRouter provides several PDF processing engines:

1. <code>"{PDFParserEngine.MistralOCR}"</code>: Best for scanned documents or
   PDFs with images (\${MISTRAL_OCR_COST.toString()} per 1,000 pages).
2. <code>"{PDFParserEngine.PDFText}"</code>: Best for well-structured PDFs with
   clear text content (Free).
3. <code>"{PDFParserEngine.Native}"</code>: Only available for models that
   support file input natively (charged as input tokens).

If you don't explicitly specify an engine, OpenRouter will default first to the model's native file processing capabilities, and if that's not available, we will use the <code>"{DEFAULT_PDF_ENGINE}"</code> engine.

## Using PDF URLs

For publicly accessible PDFs, you can send the URL directly without needing to download and encode the file:

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4',
  ENGINE: PDFParserEngine.MistralOCR,
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python
    import requests
    import json

    url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY_REF}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    messages = [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "What are the main points in this document?"
                },
                {
                    "type": "file",
                    "file": {
                        "filename": "document.pdf",
                        "file_data": "https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"
                    }
                },
            ]
        }
    ]

    # Optional: Configure PDF processing engine
    plugins = [
        {
            "id": "file-parser",
            "pdf": {
                "engine": "{{ENGINE}}"
            }
        }
    ]

    payload = {
        "model": "{{MODEL}}",
        "messages": messages,
        "plugins": plugins
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    print(response.json())
    ```

    ```typescript
    const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY_REF}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        messages: [
          {
            role: 'user',
            content: [
              {
                type: 'text',
                text: 'What are the main points in this document?',
              },
              {
                type: 'file',
                file: {
                  filename: 'document.pdf',
                  file_data: 'https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf',
                },
              },
            ],
          },
        ],
        // Optional: Configure PDF processing engine
        plugins: [
          {
            id: 'file-parser',
            pdf: {
              engine: '{{ENGINE}}',
            },
          },
        ],
      }),
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

<Info>
  PDF URLs work with all processing engines. For Mistral OCR, the URL is passed directly to the service. For other engines, OpenRouter fetches the PDF and processes it internally.
</Info>

## Using Base64 Encoded PDFs

For local PDF files or when you need to send PDF content directly, you can base64 encode the file:

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'google/gemma-3-27b-it',
  ENGINE: PDFParserEngine.PDFText,
  DEFAULT_PDF_ENGINE,
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python
    import requests
    import json
    import base64
    from pathlib import Path

    def encode_pdf_to_base64(pdf_path):
        with open(pdf_path, "rb") as pdf_file:
            return base64.b64encode(pdf_file.read()).decode('utf-8')

    url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY_REF}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    # Read and encode the PDF
    pdf_path = "path/to/your/document.pdf"
    base64_pdf = encode_pdf_to_base64(pdf_path)
    data_url = f"data:application/pdf;base64,{base64_pdf}"

    messages = [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "What are the main points in this document?"
                },
                {
                    "type": "file",
                    "file": {
                        "filename": "document.pdf",
                        "file_data": data_url
                    }
                },
            ]
        }
    ]

    # Optional: Configure PDF processing engine
    # PDF parsing will still work even if the plugin is not explicitly set
    plugins = [
        {
            "id": "file-parser",
            "pdf": {
                "engine": "{{ENGINE}}"  # defaults to "{{DEFAULT_PDF_ENGINE}}". See Pricing above
            }
        }
    ]

    payload = {
        "model": "{{MODEL}}",
        "messages": messages,
        "plugins": plugins
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    print(response.json())
    ```

    ```typescript
    async function encodePDFToBase64(pdfPath: string): Promise<string> {
      const pdfBuffer = await fs.promises.readFile(pdfPath);
      const base64PDF = pdfBuffer.toString('base64');
      return `data:application/pdf;base64,${base64PDF}`;
    }

    // Read and encode the PDF
    const pdfPath = 'path/to/your/document.pdf';
    const base64PDF = await encodePDFToBase64(pdfPath);

    const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY_REF}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        messages: [
          {
            role: 'user',
            content: [
              {
                type: 'text',
                text: 'What are the main points in this document?',
              },
              {
                type: 'file',
                file: {
                  filename: 'document.pdf',
                  file_data: base64PDF,
                },
              },
            ],
          },
        ],
        // Optional: Configure PDF processing engine
        // PDF parsing will still work even if the plugin is not explicitly set
        plugins: [
          {
            id: 'file-parser',
            pdf: {
              engine: '{{ENGINE}}', // defaults to "{{DEFAULT_PDF_ENGINE}}". See Pricing above
            },
          },
        ],
      }),
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

## Skip Parsing Costs

When you send a PDF to the API, the response may include file annotations in the assistant's message. These annotations contain structured information about the PDF document that was parsed. By sending these annotations back in subsequent requests, you can avoid re-parsing the same PDF document multiple times, which saves both processing time and costs.

Here's how to reuse file annotations:

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'google/gemma-3-27b-it'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python
    import requests
    import json
    import base64
    from pathlib import Path

    # First, encode and send the PDF
    def encode_pdf_to_base64(pdf_path):
        with open(pdf_path, "rb") as pdf_file:
            return base64.b64encode(pdf_file.read()).decode('utf-8')

    url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY_REF}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    # Read and encode the PDF
    pdf_path = "path/to/your/document.pdf"
    base64_pdf = encode_pdf_to_base64(pdf_path)
    data_url = f"data:application/pdf;base64,{base64_pdf}"

    # Initial request with the PDF
    messages = [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "What are the main points in this document?"
                },
                {
                    "type": "file",
                    "file": {
                        "filename": "document.pdf",
                        "file_data": data_url
                    }
                },
            ]
        }
    ]

    payload = {
        "model": "{{MODEL}}",
        "messages": messages
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    response_data = response.json()

    # Store the annotations from the response
    file_annotations = None
    if response_data.get("choices") and len(response_data["choices"]) > 0:
        if "annotations" in response_data["choices"][0]["message"]:

<Info>
  When you include the file annotations from a previous response in your
  subsequent requests, OpenRouter will use this pre-parsed information instead
  of re-parsing the PDF, which saves processing time and costs. This is
  especially beneficial for large documents or when using the `mistral-ocr`
  engine which incurs additional costs.
</Info>

## Response Format

The API will return a response in the following format:

```json
{
  "id": "gen-1234567890",
  "provider": "DeepInfra",
  "model": "google/gemma-3-27b-it",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1234567890,
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The document discusses..."
      }
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 1000,
    "completion_tokens": 100,
    "total_tokens": 1100
  }
}
```

# Audio Inputs

> Send audio files to speech-capable models through the OpenRouter API.

OpenRouter supports sending audio files to compatible models via the API. This guide will show you how to work with audio using our API.

**Note**: Audio files must be **base64-encoded** - direct URLs are not supported for audio content.

## Audio Inputs

Requests with audio files to compatible models are available via the `/api/v1/chat/completions` API with the `input_audio` content type. Audio files must be base64-encoded and include the format specification. Note that only models with audio processing capabilities will handle these requests.

You can search for models that support audio by filtering to audio input modality on our [Models page](/models?fmt=cards\&input_modalities=audio).

### Sending Audio Files

Here's how to send an audio file for processing:

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'google/gemini-2.5-flash'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python
    import requests
    import json
    import base64

    def encode_audio_to_base64(audio_path):
        with open(audio_path, "rb") as audio_file:
            return base64.b64encode(audio_file.read()).decode('utf-8')

    url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY_REF}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    # Read and encode the audio file
    audio_path = "path/to/your/audio.wav"
    base64_audio = encode_audio_to_base64(audio_path)

    messages = [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "Please transcribe this audio file."
                },
                {
                    "type": "input_audio",
                    "input_audio": {
                        "data": base64_audio,
                        "format": "wav"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]

    payload = {
        "model": "{{MODEL}}",
        "messages": messages
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    print(response.json())
    ```

    ```typescript
    import fs from "fs/promises";

    async function encodeAudioToBase64(audioPath: string): Promise<string> {
      const audioBuffer = await fs.readFile(audioPath);
      return audioBuffer.toString("base64");
    }

    // Read and encode the audio file
    const audioPath = "path/to/your/audio.wav";
    const base64Audio = await encodeAudioToBase64(audioPath);

    const response = await fetch("https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY_REF}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: "{{MODEL}}",
        messages: [
          {
            role: "user",
            content: [
              {
                type: "text",
                text: "Please transcribe this audio file.",
              },
              {
                type: "input_audio",
                input_audio: {
                  data: base64Audio,
                  format: "wav",
                },
              },
            ],
          },
        ],
      }),
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

Supported audio formats are:

* `wav`
* `mp3`

# Message Transforms

> Transform and optimize messages before sending them to AI models. Learn about middle-out compression and context window optimization with OpenRouter.

To help with prompts that exceed the maximum context size of a model, OpenRouter supports a custom parameter called `transforms`:

```typescript
{
  transforms: ["middle-out"], // Compress prompts that are > context size.
  messages: [...],
  model // Works with any model
}
```

This can be useful for situations where perfect recall is not required. The transform works by removing or truncating messages from the middle of the prompt, until the prompt fits within the model's context window.

In some cases, the issue is not the token context length, but the actual number of messages. The transform addresses this as well: For instance, Anthropic's Claude models enforce a maximum of {anthropicMaxMessagesCount} messages. When this limit is exceeded with middle-out enabled, the transform will keep half of the messages from the start and half from the end of the conversation.

When middle-out compression is enabled, OpenRouter will first try to find models whose context length is at least half of your total required tokens (input + completion). For example, if your prompt requires 10,000 tokens total, models with at least 5,000 context length will be considered. If no models meet this criteria, OpenRouter will fall back to using the model with the highest available context length.

The compression will then attempt to fit your content within the chosen model's context window by removing or truncating content from the middle of the prompt. If middle-out compression is disabled and your total tokens exceed the model's context length, the request will fail with an error message suggesting you either reduce the length or enable middle-out compression.

<Note>
  [All OpenRouter endpoints](/models) with 8k (8,192 tokens) or less context
  length will default to using `middle-out`. To disable this, set `transforms:   []` in the request body.
</Note>

The middle of the prompt is compressed because [LLMs pay less attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172) to the middle of sequences.

# Uptime Optimization

> Learn how OpenRouter maximizes AI model uptime through real-time monitoring, intelligent routing, and automatic fallbacks across multiple providers.

OpenRouter continuously monitors the health and availability of AI providers to ensure maximum uptime for your applications. We track response times, error rates, and availability across all providers in real-time, and route based on this feedback.

## How It Works

OpenRouter tracks response times, error rates, and availability across all providers in real-time. This data helps us make intelligent routing decisions and provides transparency about service reliability.

## Uptime Example: Claude 4 Sonnet

<UptimeChart permaslug="anthropic/claude-4-sonnet-20250522" />

## Uptime Example: Llama 3.3 70B Instruct

<UptimeChart permaslug="meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct" />

## Customizing Provider Selection

While our smart routing helps maintain high availability, you can also customize provider selection using request parameters. This gives you control over which providers handle your requests while still benefiting from automatic fallback when needed.

Learn more about customizing provider selection in our [Provider Routing documentation](/docs/features/provider-routing).

# Web Search

> Enable real-time web search capabilities in your AI model responses. Add factual, up-to-date information to any model's output with OpenRouter's web search feature.

You can incorporate relevant web search results for *any* model on OpenRouter by activating and customizing the `web` plugin, or by appending `:online` to the model slug:

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4o:online"
}
```

This is a shortcut for using the `web` plugin, and is exactly equivalent to:

```json
{
  "model": "openrouter/auto",
  "plugins": [{ "id": "web" }]
}
```

The web search plugin is powered by [Exa](https://exa.ai) and uses their ["auto"](https://docs.exa.ai/reference/how-exa-search-works#combining-neural-and-keyword-the-best-of-both-worlds-through-exa-auto-search) method (a combination of keyword search and embeddings-based web search) to find the most relevant results and augment/ground your prompt.

## Parsing web search results

Web search results for all models (including native-only models like Perplexity and OpenAI Online) are available in the API and standardized by OpenRouterto follow the same annotation schema in the [OpenAI Chat Completion Message type](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/object):

```json
{
  "message": {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Here's the latest news I found: ...",
    "annotations": [
      {
        "type": "url_citation",
        "url_citation": {
          "url": "https://www.example.com/web-search-result",
          "title": "Title of the web search result",
          "content": "Content of the web search result", // Added by OpenRouter if available
          "start_index": 100, // The index of the first character of the URL citation in the message.
          "end_index": 200 // The index of the last character of the URL citation in the message.
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Customizing the Web Plugin

The maximum results allowed by the web plugin and the prompt used to attach them to your message stream can be customized:

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4o:online",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "id": "web",
      "max_results": 1, // Defaults to 5
      "search_prompt": "Some relevant web results:" // See default below
    }
  ]
}
```

By default, the web plugin uses the following search prompt, using the current date:

```
A web search was conducted on `date`. Incorporate the following web search results into your response.

IMPORTANT: Cite them using markdown links named using the domain of the source.
Example: [nytimes.com](https://nytimes.com/some-page).
```

## Pricing

The web plugin uses your OpenRouter credits and charges *\$4 per 1000 results*. By default, `max_results` set to 5, this comes out to a maximum of \$0.02 per request, in addition to the LLM usage for the search result prompt tokens.

## Non-plugin Web Search

Some models have built-in web search. These models charge a fee based on the search context size, which determines how much search data is retrieved and processed for a query.

### Search Context Size Thresholds

Search context can be 'low', 'medium', or 'high' and determines how much search context is retrieved for a query:

* **Low**: Minimal search context, suitable for basic queries
* **Medium**: Moderate search context, good for general queries
* **High**: Extensive search context, ideal for detailed research

### Specifying Search Context Size

You can specify the search context size in your API request using the `web_search_options` parameter:

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4.1",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?"
    }
  ],
  "web_search_options": {
    "search_context_size": "high"
  }
}
```

# Zero Completion Insurance

> Learn how OpenRouter protects users from being charged for failed or empty AI responses with zero completion insurance.

OpenRouter provides zero completion insurance to protect users from being charged for failed or empty responses. When a response contains no output tokens and either has a blank finish reason or an error, you will not be charged for the request, even if the underlying provider charges for prompt processing.

<Note>
  Zero completion insurance is automatically enabled for all accounts and requires no configuration.
</Note>

## How It Works

Zero completion insurance automatically applies to all requests across all models and providers. When a response meets either of these conditions, no credits will be deducted from your account:

* The response has zero completion tokens AND a blank/null finish reason
* The response has an error finish reason

## Viewing Protected Requests

On your activity page, requests that were protected by zero completion insurance will show zero credits deducted. This applies even in cases where OpenRouter may have been charged by the provider for prompt processing.

# Provisioning API Keys

> Manage OpenRouter API keys programmatically through dedicated management endpoints. Create, read, update, and delete API keys for automated key distribution and control.

OpenRouter provides endpoints to programmatically manage your API keys, enabling key creation and management for applications that need to distribute or rotate keys automatically.

## Creating a Provisioning API Key

To use the key management API, you first need to create a Provisioning API key:

1. Go to the [Provisioning API Keys page](https://openrouter.ai/settings/provisioning-keys)
2. Click "Create New Key"
3. Complete the key creation process

Provisioning keys cannot be used to make API calls to OpenRouter's completion endpoints - they are exclusively for key management operations.

## Use Cases

Common scenarios for programmatic key management include:

* **SaaS Applications**: Automatically create unique API keys for each customer instance
* **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys for security compliance
* **Usage Monitoring**: Track key usage and automatically disable keys that exceed limits

## Example Usage

All key management endpoints are under `/api/v1/keys` and require a Provisioning API key in the Authorization header.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python title="Python"
  import requests

  PROVISIONING_API_KEY = "your-provisioning-key"
  BASE_URL = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/keys"

  # List the most recent 100 API keys
  response = requests.get(
      BASE_URL,
      headers={
          "Authorization": f"Bearer {PROVISIONING_API_KEY}",
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
      }
  )

  # You can paginate using the offset parameter
  response = requests.get(
      f"{BASE_URL}?offset=100",
      headers={
          "Authorization": f"Bearer {PROVISIONING_API_KEY}",
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
      }
  )

  # Create a new API key
  response = requests.post(
      f"{BASE_URL}/",
      headers={
          "Authorization": f"Bearer {PROVISIONING_API_KEY}",
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      json={
          "name": "Customer Instance Key",
          "label": "customer-123",
          "limit": 1000  # Optional credit limit
      }
  )

  # Get a specific key
  key_hash = "<YOUR_KEY_HASH>"
  response = requests.get(
      f"{BASE_URL}/{key_hash}",
      headers={
          "Authorization": f"Bearer {PROVISIONING_API_KEY}",
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
      }
  )

  # Update a key
  response = requests.patch(
      f"{BASE_URL}/{key_hash}",
      headers={
          "Authorization": f"Bearer {PROVISIONING_API_KEY}",
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      json={
          "name": "Updated Key Name",
          "disabled": True,  # Disable the key
          "include_byok_in_limit": False  # Optional: control BYOK usage in limit
      }
  )

  # Delete a key
  response = requests.delete(
      f"{BASE_URL}/{key_hash}",
      headers={
          "Authorization": f"Bearer {PROVISIONING_API_KEY}",
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
      }
  )
  ```

  ```typescript title="TypeScript"
  const PROVISIONING_API_KEY = 'your-provisioning-key';
  const BASE_URL = 'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/keys';

  // List the most recent 100 API keys
  const listKeys = await fetch(BASE_URL, {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${PROVISIONING_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  });

  // You can paginate using the `offset` query parameter
  const listKeys = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}?offset=100`, {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${PROVISIONING_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  });

  // Create a new API key
  const createKey = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${PROVISIONING_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: 'Customer Instance Key',
      label: 'customer-123',
      limit: 1000, // Optional credit limit
    }),
  });

  // Get a specific key
  const keyHash = '<YOUR_KEY_HASH>';
  const getKey = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/${keyHash}`, {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${PROVISIONING_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  });

  // Update a key
  const updateKey = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/${keyHash}`, {
    method: 'PATCH',
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${PROVISIONING_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: 'Updated Key Name',
      disabled: true, // Disable the key
      include_byok_in_limit: false, // Optional: control BYOK usage in limit
    }),
  });

  // Delete a key
  const deleteKey = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/${keyHash}`, {
    method: 'DELETE',
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${PROVISIONING_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Response Format

API responses return JSON objects containing key information:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "created_at": "2025-02-19T20:52:27.363244+00:00",
      "updated_at": "2025-02-19T21:24:11.708154+00:00",
      "hash": "<YOUR_KEY_HASH>",
      "label": "sk-or-v1-customkey",
      "name": "Customer Key",
      "disabled": false,
      "limit": 10,
      "usage": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

When creating a new key, the response will include the key string itself.

# App Attribution

> Learn how to attribute your API usage to your app and appear in OpenRouter's app rankings and model analytics.

App attribution allows developers to associate their API usage with their application, enabling visibility in OpenRouter's public rankings and detailed analytics. By including simple headers in your requests, your app can appear in our leaderboards and gain insights into your model usage patterns.

## Benefits of App Attribution

When you properly attribute your app usage, you gain access to:

* **Public App Rankings**: Your app appears in OpenRouter's [public rankings](https://openrouter.ai/rankings) with daily, weekly, and monthly leaderboards
* **Model Apps Tabs**: Your app is featured on individual model pages showing which apps use each model most
* **Detailed Analytics**: Access comprehensive analytics showing your app's model usage over time, token consumption, and usage patterns
* **Professional Visibility**: Showcase your app to the OpenRouter developer community

## Attribution Headers

OpenRouter tracks app attribution through two optional HTTP headers:

### HTTP-Referer

The `HTTP-Referer` header identifies your app's URL and is used as the primary identifier for rankings.

### X-Title

The `X-Title` header sets or modifies your app's display name in rankings and analytics.

<Tip>
  Both headers are optional, but including them enables all attribution features. Apps using localhost URLs must include a title to be tracked.
</Tip>

## Implementation Examples

<CodeGroup>
  ```python title="Python (OpenAI SDK)"
  from openai import OpenAI

  client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
    api_key="<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>",
  )

  completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    extra_headers={
      "HTTP-Referer": "https://myapp.com", # Your app's URL
      "X-Title": "My AI Assistant", # Your app's display name
    },
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    messages=[
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello, world!"
      }
    ]
  )
  ```

  ```typescript title="TypeScript (OpenAI SDK)"
  import OpenAI from 'openai';

  const openai = new OpenAI({
    baseURL: 'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1',
    apiKey: '<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
    defaultHeaders: {
      'HTTP-Referer': 'https://myapp.com', // Your app's URL
      'X-Title': 'My AI Assistant', // Your app's display name
    },
  });

  async function main() {
    const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: 'Hello, world!',
        },
      ],
    });

    console.log(completion.choices[0].message);
  }

  main();
  ```

  ```python title="Python (Direct API)"
  import requests
  import json

  response = requests.post(
    url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions",
    headers={
      "Authorization": "Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>",
      "HTTP-Referer": "https://myapp.com", # Your app's URL
      "X-Title": "My AI Assistant", # Your app's display name
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    data=json.dumps({
      "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "Hello, world!"
        }
      ]
    })
  )
  ```

  ```typescript title="TypeScript (Fetch)"
  fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      Authorization: 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
      'HTTP-Referer': 'https://myapp.com', // Your app's URL
      'X-Title': 'My AI Assistant', // Your app's display name
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: 'Hello, world!',
        },
      ],
    }),
  });
  ```

  ```shell title="cURL"
  curl https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENROUTER_API_KEY" \
    -H "HTTP-Referer: https://myapp.com" \
    -H "X-Title: My AI Assistant" \
    -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello, world!"
      }
    ]
  }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Where Your App Appears

### App Rankings

Your attributed app will appear in OpenRouter's main rankings page at [openrouter.ai/rankings](https://openrouter.ai/rankings). The rankings show:

* **Top Apps**: Largest public apps by token usage
* **Time Periods**: Daily, weekly, and monthly views
* **Usage Metrics**: Total token consumption across all models

### Model Apps Tabs

On individual model pages (e.g., [GPT-4o](https://openrouter.ai/models/openai/gpt-4o)), your app will be featured in the "Apps" tab showing:

* **Top Apps**: Apps using that specific model most
* **Weekly Rankings**: Updated weekly based on usage
* **Usage Context**: How your app compares to others using the same model

### Individual App Analytics

Once your app is tracked, you can access detailed analytics at `openrouter.ai/apps?url=<your-app-url>` including:

* **Model Usage Over Time**: Charts showing which models your app uses
* **Token Consumption**: Detailed breakdown of prompt and completion tokens
* **Usage Patterns**: Historical data to understand your app's AI usage trends

## Best Practices

### URL Requirements

* Use your app's primary domain (e.g., `https://myapp.com`)
* Avoid using subdomains unless they represent distinct apps
* For localhost development, always include a title header

### Title Guidelines

* Keep titles concise and descriptive
* Use your app's actual name as users know it
* Avoid generic names like "AI App" or "Chatbot"

### Privacy Considerations

* Only public apps, meaning those that send headers, are included in rankings
* Attribution headers don't expose sensitive information about your requests

# API Reference

> Comprehensive guide to OpenRouter's API. Learn about request/response schemas, authentication, parameters, and integration with multiple AI model providers.

OpenRouter's request and response schemas are very similar to the OpenAI Chat API, with a few small differences. At a high level, **OpenRouter normalizes the schema across models and providers** so you only need to learn one.

## Requests

### Completions Request Format

Here is the request schema as a TypeScript type. This will be the body of your `POST` request to the `/api/v1/chat/completions` endpoint (see the [quick start](/docs/quick-start) above for an example).

For a complete list of parameters, see the [Parameters](/docs/api-reference/parameters).

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="Request Schema"
  // Definitions of subtypes are below
  type Request = {
    // Either "messages" or "prompt" is required
    messages?: Message[];
    prompt?: string;

    // If "model" is unspecified, uses the user's default
    model?: string; // See "Supported Models" section

    // Allows to force the model to produce specific output format.
    // See models page and note on this docs page for which models support it.
    response_format?: { type: 'json_object' };

    stop?: string | string[];
    stream?: boolean; // Enable streaming

    // See LLM Parameters (openrouter.ai/docs/api-reference/parameters)
    max_tokens?: number; // Range: [1, context_length)
    temperature?: number; // Range: [0, 2]

    // Tool calling
    // Will be passed down as-is for providers implementing OpenAI's interface.
    // For providers with custom interfaces, we transform and map the properties.
    // Otherwise, we transform the tools into a YAML template. The model responds with an assistant message.
    // See models supporting tool calling: openrouter.ai/models?supported_parameters=tools
    tools?: Tool[];
    tool_choice?: ToolChoice;

    // Advanced optional parameters
    seed?: number; // Integer only
    top_p?: number; // Range: (0, 1]
    top_k?: number; // Range: [1, Infinity) Not available for OpenAI models
    frequency_penalty?: number; // Range: [-2, 2]
    presence_penalty?: number; // Range: [-2, 2]
    repetition_penalty?: number; // Range: (0, 2]
    logit_bias?: { [key: number]: number };
    top_logprobs: number; // Integer only
    min_p?: number; // Range: [0, 1]
    top_a?: number; // Range: [0, 1]

    // Reduce latency by providing the model with a predicted output
    // https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/latency-optimization#use-predicted-outputs
    prediction?: { type: 'content'; content: string };

    // OpenRouter-only parameters
    // See "Prompt Transforms" section: openrouter.ai/docs/transforms
    transforms?: string[];
    // See "Model Routing" section: openrouter.ai/docs/model-routing
    models?: string[];
    route?: 'fallback';
    // See "Provider Routing" section: openrouter.ai/docs/provider-routing
    provider?: ProviderPreferences;
    user?: string; // A stable identifier for your end-users. Used to help detect and prevent abuse.
  };

  // Subtypes:

  type TextContent = {
    type: 'text';
    text: string;
  };

  type ImageContentPart = {
    type: 'image_url';
    image_url: {
      url: string; // URL or base64 encoded image data
      detail?: string; // Optional, defaults to "auto"
    };
  };

  type ContentPart = TextContent | ImageContentPart;

  type Message =
    | {
        role: 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system';
        // ContentParts are only for the "user" role:
        content: string | ContentPart[];
        // If "name" is included, it will be prepended like this
        // for non-OpenAI models: `{name}: {content}`
        name?: string;
      }
    | {
        role: 'tool';
        content: string;
        tool_call_id: string;
        name?: string;
      };

  type FunctionDescription = {
    description?: string;
    name: string;
    parameters: object; // JSON Schema object
  };

  type Tool = {
    type: 'function';
    function: FunctionDescription;
  };

  type ToolChoice =
    | 'none'
    | 'auto'
    | {
        type: 'function';
        function: {
          name: string;
        };
      };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The `response_format` parameter ensures you receive a structured response from the LLM. The parameter is only supported by OpenAI models, Nitro models, and some others - check the providers on the model page on openrouter.ai/models to see if it's supported, and set `require_parameters` to true in your Provider Preferences. See [Provider Routing](/docs/features/provider-routing)

### Headers

OpenRouter allows you to specify some optional headers to identify your app and make it discoverable to users on our site.

* `HTTP-Referer`: Identifies your app on openrouter.ai
* `X-Title`: Sets/modifies your app's title

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="TypeScript"
  fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      Authorization: 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
      'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>', // Optional. Site URL for rankings on openrouter.ai.
      'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>', // Optional. Site title for rankings on openrouter.ai.
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: 'What is the meaning of life?',
        },
      ],
    }),
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info title="Model routing">
  If the `model` parameter is omitted, the user or payer's default is used.
  Otherwise, remember to select a value for `model` from the [supported
  models](/models) or [API](/api/v1/models), and include the organization
  prefix. OpenRouter will select the least expensive and best GPUs available to
  serve the request, and fall back to other providers or GPUs if it receives a
  5xx response code or if you are rate-limited.
</Info>

<Info title="Streaming">
  [Server-Sent Events
  (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#event_stream_format)
  are supported as well, to enable streaming *for all models*. Simply send
  `stream: true` in your request body. The SSE stream will occasionally contain
  a "comment" payload, which you should ignore (noted below).
</Info>

<Info title="Non-standard parameters">
  If the chosen model doesn't support a request parameter (such as `logit_bias`
  in non-OpenAI models, or `top_k` for OpenAI), then the parameter is ignored.
  The rest are forwarded to the underlying model API.
</Info>

### Assistant Prefill

OpenRouter supports asking models to complete a partial response. This can be useful for guiding models to respond in a certain way.

To use this features, simply include a message with `role: "assistant"` at the end of your `messages` array.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="TypeScript"
  fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      Authorization: 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
      messages: [
        { role: 'user', content: 'What is the meaning of life?' },
        { role: 'assistant', content: "I'm not sure, but my best guess is" },
      ],
    }),
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Responses

### CompletionsResponse Format

OpenRouter normalizes the schema across models and providers to comply with the [OpenAI Chat API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat).

This means that `choices` is always an array, even if the model only returns one completion. Each choice will contain a `delta` property if a stream was requested and a `message` property otherwise. This makes it easier to use the same code for all models.

Here's the response schema as a TypeScript type:

```typescript TypeScript
// Definitions of subtypes are below
type Response = {
  id: string;
  // Depending on whether you set "stream" to "true" and
  // whether you passed in "messages" or a "prompt", you
  // will get a different output shape
  choices: (NonStreamingChoice | StreamingChoice | NonChatChoice)[];
  created: number; // Unix timestamp
  model: string;
  object: 'chat.completion' | 'chat.completion.chunk';

  system_fingerprint?: string; // Only present if the provider supports it

  // Usage data is always returned for non-streaming.
  // When streaming, you will get one usage object at
  // the end accompanied by an empty choices array.
  usage?: ResponseUsage;
};
```

```typescript
// If the provider returns usage, we pass it down
// as-is. Otherwise, we count using the GPT-4 tokenizer.

type ResponseUsage = {
  /** Including images and tools if any */
  prompt_tokens: number;
  /** The tokens generated */
  completion_tokens: number;
  /** Sum of the above two fields */
  total_tokens: number;
};
```

```typescript
// Subtypes:
type NonChatChoice = {
  finish_reason: string | null;
  text: string;
  error?: ErrorResponse;
};

type NonStreamingChoice = {
  finish_reason: string | null;
  native_finish_reason: string | null;
  message: {
    content: string | null;
    role: string;
    tool_calls?: ToolCall[];
  };
  error?: ErrorResponse;
};

type StreamingChoice = {
  finish_reason: string | null;
  native_finish_reason: string | null;
  delta: {
    content: string | null;
    role?: string;
    tool_calls?: ToolCall[];
  };
  error?: ErrorResponse;
};

type ErrorResponse = {
  code: number; // See "Error Handling" section
  message: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>; // Contains additional error information such as provider details, the raw error message, etc.
};

type ToolCall = {
  id: string;
  type: 'function';
  function: FunctionCall;
};
```

Here's an example:

```json
{
  "id": "gen-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "choices": [
    {
      "finish_reason": "stop", // Normalized finish_reason
      "native_finish_reason": "stop", // The raw finish_reason from the provider
      "message": {
        // will be "delta" if streaming
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Hello there!"
      }
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 0,
    "completion_tokens": 4,
    "total_tokens": 4
  },
  "model": "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo" // Could also be "anthropic/claude-2.1", etc, depending on the "model" that ends up being used
}
```

### Finish Reason

OpenRouter normalizes each model's `finish_reason` to one of the following values: `tool_calls`, `stop`, `length`, `content_filter`, `error`.

Some models and providers may have additional finish reasons. The raw finish\_reason string returned by the model is available via the `native_finish_reason` property.

### Querying Cost and Stats

The token counts that are returned in the completions API response are **not** counted via the model's native tokenizer. Instead it uses a normalized, model-agnostic count (accomplished via the GPT4o tokenizer). This is because some providers do not reliably return native token counts. This behavior is becoming more rare, however, and we may add native token counts to the response object in the future.

Credit usage and model pricing are based on the **native** token counts (not the 'normalized' token counts returned in the API response).

For precise token accounting using the model's native tokenizer, you can retrieve the full generation information via the `/api/v1/generation` endpoint.

You can use the returned `id` to query for the generation stats (including token counts and cost) after the request is complete. This is how you can get the cost and tokens for *all models and requests*, streaming and non-streaming.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="Query Generation Stats"
  const generation = await fetch(
    'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/generation?id=$GENERATION_ID',
    { headers },
  );

  const stats = await generation.json();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Please see the [Generation](/docs/api-reference/get-a-generation) API reference for the full response shape.

Note that token counts are also available in the `usage` field of the response body for non-streaming completions.

# Streaming

> Learn how to implement streaming responses with OpenRouter's API. Complete guide to Server-Sent Events (SSE) and real-time model outputs.

The OpenRouter API allows streaming responses from *any model*. This is useful for building chat interfaces or other applications where the UI should update as the model generates the response.

To enable streaming, you can set the `stream` parameter to `true` in your request. The model will then stream the response to the client in chunks, rather than returning the entire response at once.

Here is an example of how to stream a response, and process it:

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: Model.GPT_4_Omni
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import requests
    import json

    question = "How would you build the tallest building ever?"

    url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions"
    headers = {
      "Authorization": f"Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}",
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    payload = {
      "model": "{{MODEL}}",
      "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": question}],
      "stream": True
    }

    buffer = ""
    with requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload, stream=True) as r:
      for chunk in r.iter_content(chunk_size=1024, decode_unicode=True):
        buffer += chunk
        while True:
          try:
            # Find the next complete SSE line
            line_end = buffer.find('\n')
            if line_end == -1:
              break

            line = buffer[:line_end].strip()
            buffer = buffer[line_end + 1:]

            if line.startswith('data: '):
              data = line[6:]
              if data == '[DONE]':
                break

              try:
                data_obj = json.loads(data)
                content = data_obj["choices"][0]["delta"].get("content")
                if content:
                  print(content, end="", flush=True)
              except json.JSONDecodeError:
                pass
          except Exception:
            break
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    const question = 'How would you build the tallest building ever?';
    const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY_REF}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        messages: [{ role: 'user', content: question }],
        stream: true,
      }),
    });

    const reader = response.body?.getReader();
    if (!reader) {
      throw new Error('Response body is not readable');
    }

    const decoder = new TextDecoder();
    let buffer = '';

    try {
      while (true) {
        const { done, value } = await reader.read();
        if (done) break;

        // Append new chunk to buffer
        buffer += decoder.decode(value, { stream: true });

        // Process complete lines from buffer
        while (true) {
          const lineEnd = buffer.indexOf('\n');
          if (lineEnd === -1) break;

          const line = buffer.slice(0, lineEnd).trim();
          buffer = buffer.slice(lineEnd + 1);

          if (line.startsWith('data: ')) {
            const data = line.slice(6);
            if (data === '[DONE]') break;

            try {
              const parsed = JSON.parse(data);
              const content = parsed.choices[0].delta.content;
              if (content) {
                console.log(content);
              }
            } catch (e) {
              // Ignore invalid JSON
            }
          }
        }
      }
    } finally {
      reader.cancel();
    }
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

### Additional Information

For SSE (Server-Sent Events) streams, OpenRouter occasionally sends comments to prevent connection timeouts. These comments look like:

```text
: OPENROUTER PROCESSING
```

Comment payload can be safely ignored per the [SSE specs](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#event-stream-interpretation). However, you can leverage it to improve UX as needed, e.g. by showing a dynamic loading indicator.

Some SSE client implementations might not parse the payload according to spec, which leads to an uncaught error when you `JSON.stringify` the non-JSON payloads. We recommend the following clients:

* [eventsource-parser](https://github.com/rexxars/eventsource-parser)
* [OpenAI SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai)
* [Vercel AI SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ai)

### Stream Cancellation

Streaming requests can be cancelled by aborting the connection. For supported providers, this immediately stops model processing and billing.

To implement stream cancellation:

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: Model.GPT_4_Omni
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import requests
    from threading import Event, Thread

    def stream_with_cancellation(prompt: str, cancel_event: Event):
        with requests.Session() as session:
            response = session.post(
                "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions",
                headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}"},
                json={"model": "{{MODEL}}", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}], "stream": True},
                stream=True
            )

            try:
                for line in response.iter_lines():
                    if cancel_event.is_set():
                        response.close()
                        return
                    if line:
                        print(line.decode(), end="", flush=True)
            finally:
                response.close()

    # Example usage:
    cancel_event = Event()
    stream_thread = Thread(target=lambda: stream_with_cancellation("Write a story", cancel_event))
    stream_thread.start()

    # To cancel the stream:
    cancel_event.set()
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    const controller = new AbortController();

    try {
      const response = await fetch(
        'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions',
        {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: {
            Authorization: `Bearer ${{{API_KEY_REF}}}`,
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          },
          body: JSON.stringify({
            model: '{{MODEL}}',
            messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Write a story' }],
            stream: true,
          }),
          signal: controller.signal,
        },
      );

      // Process the stream...
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.name === 'AbortError') {
        console.log('Stream cancelled');
      } else {
        throw error;
      }
    }

    // To cancel the stream:
    controller.abort();
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

<Warning>
  Cancellation only works for streaming requests with supported providers. For
  non-streaming requests or unsupported providers, the model will continue
  processing and you will be billed for the complete response.

# Limits

> Learn about OpenRouter's API rate limits, credit-based quotas, and DDoS protection. Configure and monitor your model usage limits effectively.

<Tip>
  Making additional accounts or API keys will not affect your rate limits, as we
  govern capacity globally. We do however have different rate limits for
  different models, so you can share the load that way if you do run into
  issues.
</Tip>

## Rate Limits and Credits Remaining

To check the rate limit or credits left on an API key, make a GET request to `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/key`.

<Template data={{ API_KEY_REF }}>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript title="TypeScript"
    const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/key', {
      method: 'GET',
      headers: {
        Authorization: 'Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}',
      },
    });
    ```

    ```python title="Python"
    import requests
    import json

    response = requests.get(
      url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/key",
      headers={
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}"
      }
    )

    print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

If you submit a valid API key, you should get a response of the form:

```typescript title="TypeScript"
type Key = {
  data: {
    label: string;
    usage: number; // Number of credits used
    limit: number | null; // Credit limit for the key, or null if unlimited
    is_free_tier: boolean; // Whether the user has paid for credits before
    // rate_limit: { ... } // A deprecated object in the response, safe to ignore
  };
};
```

There are a few rate limits that apply to certain types of requests, regardless of account status:

1. Free usage limits: If you're using a free model variant (with an ID ending in <code>{sep}{Variant.Free}</code>), you can make up to {FREE_MODEL_RATE_LIMIT_RPM} requests per minute. The following per-day limits apply:

* If you have purchased less than {FREE_MODEL_CREDITS_THRESHOLD} credits, you're limited to {FREE_MODEL_NO_CREDITS_RPD} <code>{sep}{Variant.Free}</code> model requests per day.

* If you purchase at least {FREE_MODEL_CREDITS_THRESHOLD} credits, your daily limit is increased to {FREE_MODEL_HAS_CREDITS_RPD} <code>{sep}{Variant.Free}</code> model requests per day.

2. **DDoS protection**: Cloudflare's DDoS protection will block requests that dramatically exceed reasonable usage.

If your account has a negative credit balance, you may see <code>{HTTPStatus.S402_Payment_Required}</code> errors, including for free models. Adding credits to put your balance above zero allows you to use those models again.

# Authentication

> Learn how to authenticate with OpenRouter using API keys and Bearer tokens. Complete guide to secure authentication methods and best practices.

You can cover model costs with OpenRouter API keys.

Our API authenticates requests using Bearer tokens. This allows you to use `curl` or the [OpenAI SDK](https://platform.openai.com/docs/frameworks) directly with OpenRouter.

<Warning>
  API keys on OpenRouter are more powerful than keys used directly for model APIs.

  They allow users to set credit limits for apps, and they can be used in [OAuth](/docs/use-cases/oauth-pkce) flows.
</Warning>

## Using an API key

To use an API key, [first create your key](https://openrouter.ai/keys). Give it a name and you can optionally set a credit limit.

If you're calling the OpenRouter API directly, set the `Authorization` header to a Bearer token with your API key.

If you're using the OpenAI Typescript SDK, set the `api_base` to `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` and the `apiKey` to your API key.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="TypeScript (Bearer Token)"
  fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      Authorization: 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
      'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>', // Optional. Site URL for rankings on openrouter.ai.
      'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>', // Optional. Site title for rankings on openrouter.ai.
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: 'What is the meaning of life?',
        },
      ],
    }),
  });
  ```

  ```typescript title="TypeScript (OpenAI SDK)"
  import OpenAI from 'openai';

  const openai = new OpenAI({
    baseURL: 'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1',
    apiKey: '<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
    defaultHeaders: {
      'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>', // Optional. Site URL for rankings on openrouter.ai.
      'X-Title': '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>', // Optional. Site title for rankings on openrouter.ai.
    },
  });

  async function main() {
    const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],
    });

    console.log(completion.choices[0].message);
  }

  main();
  ```

  ```python title="Python"
  import openai

  openai.api_base = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
  openai.api_key = "<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>"

  response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    messages=[...],
    headers={
      "HTTP-Referer": "<YOUR_SITE_URL>", # Optional. Site URL for rankings on openrouter.ai.
      "X-Title": "<YOUR_SITE_NAME>", # Optional. Site title for rankings on openrouter.ai.
    },
  )

  reply = response.choices[0].message
  ```

  ```shell title="Shell"
  curl https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENROUTER_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
    ]
  }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

To stream with Python, [see this example from OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/How_to_stream_completions.ipynb).

## If your key has been exposed

<Warning>
  You must protect your API keys and never commit them to public repositories.
</Warning>

OpenRouter is a GitHub secret scanning partner, and has other methods to detect exposed keys. If we determine that your key has been compromised, you will receive an email notification.

If you receive such a notification or suspect your key has been exposed, immediately visit [your key settings page](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys) to delete the compromised key and create a new one.

Using environment variables and keeping keys out of your codebase is strongly recommended.

# Parameters

> Learn about all available parameters for OpenRouter API requests. Configure temperature, max tokens, top_p, and other model-specific settings.

Sampling parameters shape the token generation process of the model. You may send any parameters from the following list, as well as others, to OpenRouter.

OpenRouter will default to the values listed below if certain parameters are absent from your request (for example, `temperature` to 1.0). We will also transmit some provider-specific parameters, such as `safe_prompt` for Mistral or `raw_mode` for Hyperbolic directly to the respective providers if specified.

Please refer to the model’s provider section to confirm which parameters are supported. For detailed guidance on managing provider-specific parameters, [click here](/docs/features/provider-routing#requiring-providers-to-support-all-parameters-beta).

## Temperature

* Key: `temperature`

* Optional, **float**, 0.0 to 2.0

* Default: 1.0

* Explainer Video: [Watch](https://youtu.be/ezgqHnWvua8)

This setting influences the variety in the model's responses. Lower values lead to more predictable and typical responses, while higher values encourage more diverse and less common responses. At 0, the model always gives the same response for a given input.

## Top P

* Key: `top_p`

* Optional, **float**, 0.0 to 1.0

* Default: 1.0

* Explainer Video: [Watch](https://youtu.be/wQP-im_HInk)

This setting limits the model's choices to a percentage of likely tokens: only the top tokens whose probabilities add up to P. A lower value makes the model's responses more predictable, while the default setting allows for a full range of token choices. Think of it like a dynamic Top-K.

## Top K

* Key: `top_k`

* Optional, **integer**, 0 or above

* Default: 0

* Explainer Video: [Watch](https://youtu.be/EbZv6-N8Xlk)

This limits the model's choice of tokens at each step, making it choose from a smaller set. A value of 1 means the model will always pick the most likely next token, leading to predictable results. By default this setting is disabled, making the model to consider all choices.

## Frequency Penalty

* Key: `frequency_penalty`

* Optional, **float**, -2.0 to 2.0

* Default: 0.0

* Explainer Video: [Watch](https://youtu.be/p4gl6fqI0_w)

This setting aims to control the repetition of tokens based on how often they appear in the input. It tries to use less frequently those tokens that appear more in the input, proportional to how frequently they occur. Token penalty scales with the number of occurrences. Negative values will encourage token reuse.

## Presence Penalty

* Key: `presence_penalty`

* Optional, **float**, -2.0 to 2.0

* Default: 0.0

* Explainer Video: [Watch](https://youtu.be/MwHG5HL-P74)

Adjusts how often the model repeats specific tokens already used in the input. Higher values make such repetition less likely, while negative values do the opposite. Token penalty does not scale with the number of occurrences. Negative values will encourage token reuse.

## Repetition Penalty

* Key: `repetition_penalty`

* Optional, **float**, 0.0 to 2.0

* Default: 1.0

* Explainer Video: [Watch](https://youtu.be/LHjGAnLm3DM)

Helps to reduce the repetition of tokens from the input. A higher value makes the model less likely to repeat tokens, but too high a value can make the output less coherent (often with run-on sentences that lack small words). Token penalty scales based on original token's probability.

## Min P

* Key: `min_p`

* Optional, **float**, 0.0 to 1.0

* Default: 0.0

Represents the minimum probability for a token to be
considered, relative to the probability of the most likely token. (The value changes depending on the confidence level of the most probable token.) If your Min-P is set to 0.1, that means it will only allow for tokens that are at least 1/10th as probable as the best possible option.

## Top A

* Key: `top_a`

* Optional, **float**, 0.0 to 1.0

* Default: 0.0

Consider only the top tokens with "sufficiently high" probabilities based on the probability of the most likely token. Think of it like a dynamic Top-P. A lower Top-A value focuses the choices based on the highest probability token but with a narrower scope. A higher Top-A value does not necessarily affect the creativity of the output, but rather refines the filtering process based on the maximum probability.

## Seed

* Key: `seed`

* Optional, **integer**

If specified, the inferencing will sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed for some models.

## Max Tokens

* Key: `max_tokens`

* Optional, **integer**, 1 or above

This sets the upper limit for the number of tokens the model can generate in response. It won't produce more than this limit. The maximum value is the context length minus the prompt length.

## Logit Bias

* Key: `logit_bias`

* Optional, **map**

Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

## Logprobs

* Key: `logprobs`

* Optional, **boolean**

Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned.

## Top Logprobs

* Key: `top_logprobs`

* Optional, **integer**

An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. logprobs must be set to true if this parameter is used.

## Response Format

* Key: `response_format`

* Optional, **map**

Forces the model to produce specific output format. Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.

**Note**: when using JSON mode, you should also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message.

## Structured Outputs

* Key: `structured_outputs`

* Optional, **boolean**

If the model can return structured outputs using response\_format json\_schema.

## Stop

* Key: `stop`

* Optional, **array**

Stop generation immediately if the model encounter any token specified in the stop array.

## Tools

* Key: `tools`

* Optional, **array**

Tool calling parameter, following OpenAI's tool calling request shape. For non-OpenAI providers, it will be transformed accordingly. [Click here to learn more about tool calling](/docs/requests#tool-calls)

## Tool Choice

* Key: `tool_choice`

* Optional, **array**

Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. 'none' means the model will not call any tool and instead generates a message. 'auto' means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. 'required' means the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.

## Parallel Tool Calls

* Key: `parallel_tool_calls`

* Optional, **boolean**

* Default: **true**

Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use. If true, the model can call multiple functions simultaneously. If false, functions will be called sequentially. Only applies when tools are provided.

## Verbosity

* Key: `verbosity`

* Optional, **enum** (low, medium, high)

* Default: **medium**

Controls the verbosity and length of the model response. Lower values produce more concise responses, while higher values produce more detailed and comprehensive responses.

# Errors

> Learn how to handle errors in OpenRouter API interactions. Comprehensive guide to error codes, messages, and best practices for error handling.

For errors, OpenRouter returns a JSON response with the following shape:

```typescript
type ErrorResponse = {
  error: {
    code: number;
    message: string;
    metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
  };
};
```

The HTTP Response will have the same status code as `error.code`, forming a request error if:

* Your original request is invalid
* Your API key/account is out of credits

Otherwise, the returned HTTP response status will be <code>{HTTPStatus.S200_OK}</code> and any error occurred while the LLM is producing the output will be emitted in the response body or as an SSE data event.

Example code for printing errors in JavaScript:

```typescript
const request = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/...');
console.log(request.status); // Will be an error code unless the model started processing your request
const response = await request.json();
console.error(response.error?.status); // Will be an error code
console.error(response.error?.message);
```

## Error Codes

* **{HTTPStatus.S400_Bad_Request}**: Bad Request (invalid or missing params, CORS)
* **{HTTPStatus.S401_Unauthorized}**: Invalid credentials (OAuth session expired, disabled/invalid API key)
* **{HTTPStatus.S402_Payment_Required}**: Your account or API key has insufficient credits. Add more credits and retry the request.
* **{HTTPStatus.S403_Forbidden}**: Your chosen model requires moderation and your input was flagged
* **{HTTPStatus.S408_Request_Timeout}**: Your request timed out
* **{HTTPStatus.S429_Too_Many_Requests}**: You are being rate limited
* **{HTTPStatus.S502_Bad_Gateway}**: Your chosen model is down or we received an invalid response from it
* **{HTTPStatus.S503_Service_Unavailable}**: There is no available model provider that meets your routing requirements

## Moderation Errors

If your input was flagged, the `error.metadata` will contain information about the issue. The shape of the metadata is as follows:

```typescript
type ModerationErrorMetadata = {
  reasons: string[]; // Why your input was flagged
  flagged_input: string; // The text segment that was flagged, limited to 100 characters. If the flagged input is longer than 100 characters, it will be truncated in the middle and replaced with ...
  provider_name: string; // The name of the provider that requested moderation
  model_slug: string;
};
```

## Provider Errors

If the model provider encounters an error, the `error.metadata` will contain information about the issue. The shape of the metadata is as follows:

```typescript
type ProviderErrorMetadata = {
  provider_name: string; // The name of the provider that encountered the error
  raw: unknown; // The raw error from the provider
};
```

## When No Content is Generated

Occasionally, the model may not generate any content. This typically occurs when:

* The model is warming up from a cold start
* The system is scaling up to handle more requests

Warm-up times usually range from a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the model and provider.

If you encounter persistent no-content issues, consider implementing a simple retry mechanism or trying again with a different provider or model that has more recent activity.

Additionally, be aware that in some cases, you may still be charged for the prompt processing cost by the upstream provider, even if no content is generated.

# BYOK

> Learn how to use your existing AI provider keys with OpenRouter. Integrate your own API keys while leveraging OpenRouter's unified interface and features.

## Bring your own API Keys

OpenRouter supports both OpenRouter credits and the option to bring your own provider keys (BYOK).

When you use OpenRouter credits, your rate limits for each provider are managed by OpenRouter.

Using provider keys enables direct control over rate limits and costs via your provider account.

Your provider keys are securely encrypted and used for all requests routed through the specified provider.

Manage keys in your [account settings](/settings/integrations).

The cost of using custom provider keys on OpenRouter is **5% of what the same model/provider would cost normally on OpenRouter** and will be deducted from your OpenRouter credits.

### Key Priority and Fallback

OpenRouter always prioritizes using your provider keys when available. By default, if your key encounters a rate limit or failure, OpenRouter will fall back to using shared OpenRouter credits.

You can configure individual keys with "Always use this key" to prevent any fallback to OpenRouter credits. When this option is enabled, OpenRouter will only use your key for requests to that provider, which may result in rate limit errors if your key is exhausted, but ensures all requests go through your account.

### Azure API Keys

To use Azure AI Services with OpenRouter, you'll need to provide your Azure API key configuration in JSON format. Each key configuration requires the following fields:

```json
{
  "model_slug": "the-openrouter-model-slug",
  "endpoint_url": "https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/deployments/<model-id>/chat/completions?api-version=<api-version>",
  "api_key": "your-azure-api-key",
  "model_id": "the-azure-model-id"
}
```

You can find these values in your Azure AI Services resource:

1. **endpoint\_url**: Navigate to your Azure AI Services resource in the Azure portal. In the "Overview" section, you'll find your endpoint URL. Make sure to append `/chat/completions` to the base URL. You can read more in the [Azure Foundry documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/model-inference/concepts/endpoints?tabs=python).

2. **api\_key**: In the same "Overview" section of your Azure AI Services resource, you can find your API key under "Keys and Endpoint".

3. **model\_id**: This is the name of your model deployment in Azure AI Services.

4. **model\_slug**: This is the OpenRouter model identifier you want to use this key for.

Since Azure supports multiple model deployments, you can provide an array of configurations for different models:

```json
[
  {
    "model_slug": "mistralai/mistral-large",
    "endpoint_url": "https://example-project.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/mistral-large/chat/completions?api-version=2024-08-01-preview",
    "api_key": "your-azure-api-key",
    "model_id": "mistral-large"
  },
  {
    "model_slug": "openai/gpt-4o",
    "endpoint_url": "https://example-project.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/gpt-4o/chat/completions?api-version=2024-08-01-preview",
    "api_key": "your-azure-api-key",
    "model_id": "gpt-4o"
  }
]
```

Make sure to replace the url with your own project url. Also the url should end with /chat/completions with the api version that you would like to use.

### AWS Bedrock API Keys

To use Amazon Bedrock with OpenRouter, you can authenticate using either Bedrock API keys or traditional AWS credentials.

#### Option 1: Bedrock API Keys (Recommended)

Amazon Bedrock API keys provide a simpler authentication method. Simply provide your Bedrock API key as a string:

```
your-bedrock-api-key-here
```

**Note:** Bedrock API keys are tied to a specific AWS region and cannot be used to change regions. If you need to use models in different regions, use the AWS credentials option below.

You can generate Bedrock API keys in the AWS Management Console. Learn more in the [Amazon Bedrock API keys documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/api-keys.html).

#### Option 2: AWS Credentials

Alternatively, you can use traditional AWS credentials in JSON format. This option allows you to specify the region and provides more flexibility:

```json
{
  "accessKeyId": "your-aws-access-key-id",
  "secretAccessKey": "your-aws-secret-access-key",
  "region": "your-aws-region"
}
```

You can find these values in your AWS account:

1. **accessKeyId**: This is your AWS Access Key ID. You can create or find your access keys in the AWS Management Console under "Security Credentials" in your AWS account.

2. **secretAccessKey**: This is your AWS Secret Access Key, which is provided when you create an access key.

3. **region**: The AWS region where your Amazon Bedrock models are deployed (e.g., "us-east-1", "us-west-2").

Make sure your AWS IAM user or role has the necessary permissions to access Amazon Bedrock services. At minimum, you'll need permissions for:

* `bedrock:InvokeModel`
* `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream` (for streaming responses)

Example IAM policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "bedrock:InvokeModel",
        "bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

For enhanced security, we recommend creating dedicated IAM users with limited permissions specifically for use with OpenRouter.

Learn more in the [AWS Bedrock Getting Started with the API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/getting-started-api.html) documentation, [IAM Permissions Setup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/security-iam.html) guide, or the [AWS Bedrock API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/welcome.html).

# Crypto API

> Learn how to purchase OpenRouter credits using cryptocurrency. Complete guide to Coinbase integration, supported chains, and automated credit purchases.

You can purchase credits using cryptocurrency through our Coinbase integration. This can either happen through the UI, on your [credits page](https://openrouter.ai/settings/credits), or through our API as described below. While other forms of payment are possible, this guide specifically shows how to pay with the chain's native token.

Headless credit purchases involve three steps:

1. Getting the calldata for a new credit purchase
2. Sending a transaction on-chain using that data
3. Detecting low account balance, and purchasing more

## Getting Credit Purchase Calldata

Make a POST request to `/api/v1/credits/coinbase` to create a new charge. You'll include the amount of credits you want to purchase (in USD, up to \${maxCryptoDollarPurchase}), the address you'll be sending the transaction from, and the EVM chain ID of the network you'll be sending on.

Currently, we only support the following chains (mainnet only):

* Ethereum ({SupportedChainIDs.Ethereum})
* Polygon ({SupportedChainIDs.Polygon})
* Base ({SupportedChainIDs.Base}) ***recommended***

```typescript
const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/credits/coinbase', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    amount: 10, // Target credit amount in USD
    sender: '0x9a85CB3bfd494Ea3a8C9E50aA6a3c1a7E8BACE11',
    chain_id: 8453,
  }),
});
const responseJSON = await response.json();
```

The response includes the charge details and transaction data needed to execute the on-chain payment:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "...",
    "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "expires_at": "2024-01-01T01:00:00Z",
    "web3_data": {
      "transfer_intent": {
        "metadata": {
          "chain_id": 8453,
          "contract_address": "0x03059433bcdb6144624cc2443159d9445c32b7a8",
          "sender": "0x9a85CB3bfd494Ea3a8C9E50aA6a3c1a7E8BACE11"
        },
        "call_data": {
          "recipient_amount": "...",
          "deadline": "...",
          "recipient": "...",
          "recipient_currency": "...",
          "refund_destination": "...",
          "fee_amount": "...",
          "id": "...",
          "operator": "...",
          "signature": "...",
          "prefix": "..."
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Sending the Transaction

You can use [viem](https://viem.sh) (or another similar evm client) to execute the transaction on-chain.

In this example, we'll be fulfilling the charge using the [swapAndTransferUniswapV3Native()](https://github.com/coinbase/commerce-onchain-payment-protocol/blob/d891289bd1f41bb95f749af537f2b6a36b17f889/contracts/interfaces/ITransfers.sol#L168-L171) function. Other methods of swapping are also available, and you can learn more by checking out Coinbase's [onchain payment protocol here](https://github.com/coinbase/commerce-onchain-payment-protocol/tree/master). Note, if you are trying to pay in a less common ERC-20, there is added complexity in needing to make sure that there is sufficient liquidity in the pool to swap the tokens.

```typescript
import { createPublicClient, createWalletClient, http, parseEther } from 'viem';
import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts';
import { base } from 'viem/chains';

const txHash = await walletClient.writeContract(request);
console.log('Transaction hash:', txHash);
```

Once the transaction succeeds on chain, we'll add credits to your account. You can track the transaction status using the returned transaction hash.

Credit purchases lower than \$500 will be immediately credited once the transaction is on chain. Above \$500, there is a \~15 minute confirmation delay, ensuring the chain does not re-org your purchase.

## Detecting Low Balance

While it is possible to simply run down the balance until your app starts receiving 402 error codes for insufficient credits, this gap in service while topping up might not be desirable.

To avoid this, you can periodically call the `GET /api/v1/credits` endpoint to check your available credits.

```typescript
const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/credits', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>' },
});
const { data } = await response.json();
```

The response includes your total credits purchased and usage, where your current balance is the difference between the two:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "total_credits": 50.0,
    "total_usage": 42.0
  }
}
```

Note that these values are cached, and may be up to 60 seconds stale.

# OAuth PKCE

> Implement secure user authentication with OpenRouter using OAuth PKCE. Complete guide to setting up and managing OAuth authentication flows.

Users can connect to OpenRouter in one click using [Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/).

Here's a step-by-step guide:

## PKCE Guide

### Step 1: Send your user to OpenRouter

To start the PKCE flow, send your user to OpenRouter's `/auth` URL with a `callback_url` parameter pointing back to your site:

<CodeGroup>
  ```txt title="With S256 Code Challenge (Recommended)" wordWrap
  https://openrouter.ai/auth?callback_url=<YOUR_SITE_URL>&code_challenge=<CODE_CHALLENGE>&code_challenge_method=S256
  ```

  ```txt title="With Plain Code Challenge" wordWrap
  https://openrouter.ai/auth?callback_url=<YOUR_SITE_URL>&code_challenge=<CODE_CHALLENGE>&code_challenge_method=plain
  ```

  ```txt title="Without Code Challenge" wordWrap
  https://openrouter.ai/auth?callback_url=<YOUR_SITE_URL>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The `code_challenge` parameter is optional but recommended.

Your user will be prompted to log in to OpenRouter and authorize your app. After authorization, they will be redirected back to your site with a `code` parameter in the URL:

![Alt text](file:d24f8786-a017-4993-b7bd-4d27909d0488)

<Tip title="Use SHA-256 for Maximum Security">
  For maximum security, set `code_challenge_method` to `S256`, and set `code_challenge` to the base64 encoding of the sha256 hash of `code_verifier`.

  For more info, [visit Auth0's docs](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/call-your-api-using-the-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce#parameters).
</Tip>

#### How to Generate a Code Challenge

The following example leverages the Web Crypto API and the Buffer API to generate a code challenge for the S256 method. You will need a bundler to use the Buffer API in the web browser:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="Generate Code Challenge"
  import { Buffer } from 'buffer';

  async function createSHA256CodeChallenge(input: string) {
    const encoder = new TextEncoder();
    const data = encoder.encode(input);
    const hash = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', data);
    return Buffer.from(hash).toString('base64url');
  }

  const codeVerifier = 'your-random-string';
  const generatedCodeChallenge = await createSHA256CodeChallenge(codeVerifier);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Localhost Apps

If your app is a local-first app or otherwise doesn't have a public URL, it is recommended to test with `http://localhost:3000` as the callback and referrer URLs.

When moving to production, replace the localhost/private referrer URL with a public GitHub repo or a link to your project website.

### Step 2: Exchange the code for a user-controlled API key

After the user logs in with OpenRouter, they are redirected back to your site with a `code` parameter in the URL:

![Alt text](file:3100e56e-1c79-4430-922d-c7e4186e65f3)

Extract this code using the browser API:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="Extract Code"
  const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
  const code = urlParams.get('code');
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Then use it to make an API call to `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/auth/keys` to exchange the code for a user-controlled API key:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="Exchange Code"
  const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/auth/keys', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      code: '<CODE_FROM_QUERY_PARAM>',
      code_verifier: '<CODE_VERIFIER>', // If code_challenge was used
      code_challenge_method: '<CODE_CHALLENGE_METHOD>', // If code_challenge was used
    }),
  });

  const { key } = await response.json();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

And that's it for the PKCE flow!

### Step 3: Use the API key

Store the API key securely within the user's browser or in your own database, and use it to [make OpenRouter requests](/api-reference/completion).

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="Make an OpenRouter request"
  fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      Authorization: 'Bearer <API_KEY>',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'openai/gpt-4o',
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: 'Hello!',
        },
      ],
    }),
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Error Codes

* `400 Invalid code_challenge_method`: Make sure you're using the same code challenge method in step 1 as in step 2.
* `403 Invalid code or code_verifier`: Make sure your user is logged in to OpenRouter, and that `code_verifier` and `code_challenge_method` are correct.
* `405 Method Not Allowed`: Make sure you're using `POST` and `HTTPS` for your request.

## External Tools

* [PKCE Tools](https://example-app.com/pkce)
* [Online PKCE Generator](https://tonyxu-io.github.io/pkce-generator/)

# Using MCP Servers with OpenRouter

> Learn how to use MCP Servers with OpenRouter

MCP servers are a popular way of providing LLMs with tool calling abilities, and are an alternative to using OpenAI-compatible tool calling.

By converting MCP (Anthropic) tool definitions to OpenAI-compatible tool definitions, you can use MCP servers with OpenRouter.

In this example, we'll use [Anthropic's MCP client SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#writing-mcp-clients) to interact with the File System MCP, all with OpenRouter under the hood.

<Warning>
  Note that interacting with MCP servers is more complex than calling a REST
  endpoint. The MCP protocol is stateful and requires session management. The
  example below uses the MCP client SDK, but is still somewhat complex.
</Warning>

First, some setup. In order to run this you will need to pip install the packages, and create a `.env` file with OPENAI\_API\_KEY set. This example also assumes the directory `/Applications` exists.

```python
import asyncio
from typing import Optional
from contextlib import AsyncExitStack

from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client

from openai import OpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import json

load_dotenv()  # load environment variables from .env

MODEL = "anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet"

SERVER_CONFIG = {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y",
              "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
              f"/Applications/"],
    "env": None
}
```

Next, our helper function to convert MCP tool definitions to OpenAI tool definitions:

```python

def convert_tool_format(tool):
    converted_tool = {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": tool.name,
            "description": tool.description,
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": tool.inputSchema["properties"],
                "required": tool.inputSchema["required"]
            }
        }
    }
    return converted_tool

```

And, the MCP client itself; a regrettable \~100 lines of code. Note that the SERVER\_CONFIG is hard-coded into the client, but of course could be parameterized for other MCP servers.

```python
class MCPClient:
    def __init__(self):
        self.session: Optional[ClientSession] = None
        self.exit_stack = AsyncExitStack()
        self.openai = OpenAI(
            base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
        )

    async def connect_to_server(self, server_config):
        server_params = StdioServerParameters(**server_config)
        stdio_transport = await self.exit_stack.enter_async_context(stdio_client(server_params))
        self.stdio, self.write = stdio_transport
        self.session = await self.exit_stack.enter_async_context(ClientSession(self.stdio, self.write))

        await self.session.initialize()

        # List available tools from the MCP server
        response = await self.session.list_tools()
        print("\nConnected to server with tools:", [tool.name for tool in response.tools])

        self.messages = []

    async def process_query(self, query: str) -> str:

        self.messages.append({
            "role": "user",
            "content": query
        })

        response = await self.session.list_tools()
        available_tools = [convert_tool_format(tool) for tool in response.tools]

        response = self.openai.chat.completions.create(
            model=MODEL,
            tools=available_tools,
            messages=self.messages
        )
        self.messages.append(response.choices[0].message.model_dump())

        final_text = []
        content = response.choices[0].message
        if content.tool_calls is not None:
            tool_name = content.tool_calls[0].function.name
            tool_args = content.tool_calls[0].function.arguments
            tool_args = json.loads(tool_args) if tool_args else {}

            # Execute tool call
            try:
                result = await self.session.call_tool(tool_name, tool_args)
                final_text.append(f"[Calling tool {tool_name} with args {tool_args}]")
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error calling tool {tool_name}: {e}")
                result = None

            self.messages.append({
                "role": "tool",
                "tool_call_id": content.tool_calls[0].id,
                "name": tool_name,
                "content": result.content
            })

            response = self.openai.chat.completions.create(
                model=MODEL,
                max_tokens=1000,
                messages=self.messages,
            )

            final_text.append(response.choices[0].message.content)
        else:
            final_text.append(content.content)

        return "\n".join(final_text)

    async def chat_loop(self):
        """Run an interactive chat loop"""
        print("\nMCP Client Started!")
        print("Type your queries or 'quit' to exit.")

        while True:
            try:
                query = input("\nQuery: ").strip()
                result = await self.process_query(query)
                print("Result:")
                print(result)

            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error: {str(e)}")

    async def cleanup(self):
        await self.exit_stack.aclose()

async def main():
    client = MCPClient()
    try:
        await client.connect_to_server(SERVER_CONFIG)
        await client.chat_loop()
    finally:
        await client.cleanup()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Assembling all of the above code into mcp-client.py, you get a client that behaves as follows (some outputs truncated for brevity):

```bash
% python mcp-client.py

Secure MCP Filesystem Server running on stdio
Allowed directories: [ '/Applications' ]

Connected to server with tools: ['read_file', 'read_multiple_files', 'write_file'...]

MCP Client Started!
Type your queries or 'quit' to exit.

Query: Do I have microsoft office installed?

Result:
[Calling tool list_allowed_directories with args {}]
I can check if Microsoft Office is installed in the Applications folder:

Query: continue

Result:
[Calling tool search_files with args {'path': '/Applications', 'pattern': 'Microsoft'}]
Now let me check specifically for Microsoft Office applications:

Query: continue

Result:
I can see from the search results that Microsoft Office is indeed installed on your system.
The search found the following main Microsoft Office applications:

1. Microsoft Excel - /Applications/Microsoft Excel.app
2. Microsoft PowerPoint - /Applications/Microsoft PowerPoint.app
3. Microsoft Word - /Applications/Microsoft Word.app
4. OneDrive - /Applications/OneDrive.app (which includes Microsoft SharePoint integration)
```

# Organization Management

> Learn how to create and manage organizations on OpenRouter for team collaboration, shared credits, and centralized API management.

OpenRouter organizations enable teams and companies to collaborate effectively by sharing credits, managing API keys centrally, and tracking usage across all team members. Organizations are ideal for companies that want to pool resources, manage inference costs centrally, and maintain oversight of AI usage across their team.

## Getting Started with Organizations

### Creating an Organization

To create an organization:

1. Navigate to [Settings > Preferences](https://openrouter.ai/settings/preferences)
2. In the Organization section, click **Create Organization**
3. Follow the setup process to configure your organization details
4. Invite team members to join your organization

<Tip>
  You must have a verified email address to create an organization.
</Tip>

### Switching Between Personal and Organization Accounts

Once you're part of an organization, you can easily switch between your personal account and organization context:

* Use the **organization switcher** at the top of the web application
* When in organization mode, all actions (API usage, credit purchases, key management) are performed on behalf of the organization
* When in personal mode, you're working with your individual account resources

## Credit Management

### Shared Credit Pool

Organizations maintain a shared credit pool that offers several advantages:

* **Centralized Billing**: All credits purchased in the organization account can be used by any organization member
* **Simplified Accounting**: Track all AI inference costs in one place
* **Budget Control**: Administrators can manage spending and monitor usage across the entire team

### Admin-Only Credit Management

Only organization administrators can:

* Purchase credits for the organization
* View detailed billing information
* Manage payment methods and invoicing settings

<Warning>
  Regular organization members cannot purchase credits or access billing information. Contact your organization administrator for credit-related requests.
</Warning>

### Transferring Credits from Personal to Organization

If you need to transfer credits from your personal account to your organization account:

1. Email [support@openrouter.ai](mailto:support@openrouter.ai) with your request
2. Include your organization details and the amount you wish to transfer
3. Our support team will process the transfer manually

<Info>
  Credit transfers from personal to organization accounts require manual processing by our support team and cannot be done automatically through the interface.
</Info>

## API Key Management

Organizations provide flexible API key management with role-based permissions:

### Member Permissions

* **Create API Keys**: All organization members can create API keys
* **View Own Keys**: Members can only view and manage API keys they created
* **Use Organization Keys**: Keys created by any organization member can be used by all members
* **Shared Usage**: API usage from any organization key is billed to the organization's credit pool

### Administrator Permissions

* **View All Keys**: Administrators can view all API keys created within the organization
* **Manage All Keys**: Full access to edit, disable, or delete any organization API key
* **Monitor Usage**: Access to detailed usage analytics for all organization keys

<Tip>
  When creating API keys within an organization, consider using descriptive names that indicate the key's purpose or the team member responsible for it.
</Tip>

## Activity and Usage Tracking

### Organization-Wide Activity Feed

When viewing your activity feed while in organization context, you'll see:

* **All Member Activity**: Usage data from all organization members appears in the activity feed
* **Metadata Only**: Activity shows model usage, costs, and request metadata
* **Key Filtering**: Activity can be filtered by a specific API key to view usage for that key only

<Warning>
  **Known Limitation**: The activity feed currently shows all organization member activity when in organization context, not just your individual activity. Usage metadata (model used, cost, timing) is visible to all organization members.
</Warning>

### Usage Analytics

Organizations benefit from comprehensive usage analytics:

* Track spending across all team members
* Monitor model usage patterns
* Identify cost optimization opportunities
* Generate reports for budget planning

## Administrative Controls

### Admin-Only Settings

Organization administrators have exclusive access to:

* **Provider Settings**: Configure preferred model providers and routing preferences
* **Privacy Settings**: Manage data retention and privacy policies for the organization
* **Member Management**: Add, remove, and manage member roles
* **Billing Configuration**: Set up invoicing, payment methods, and billing contacts

### Member Role Management

Organizations support role-based access control:

* **Admin**: Full access to all organization features and settings
* **Member**: Access to create keys, use organization resources, and view own activity

## Use Cases and Benefits

### For Development Teams

* **Shared Resources**: Pool credits across multiple developers and projects
* **Centralized Management**: Manage all API keys and usage from a single dashboard
* **Cost Tracking**: Monitor spending per project or team member
* **Simplified Onboarding**: New team members can immediately access organization resources

### For Companies

* **Budget Control**: Administrators control spending and resource allocation
* **Compliance**: Centralized logging and usage tracking for audit purposes
* **Scalability**: Easy to add new team members and projects
* **Cost Optimization**: Identify usage patterns and optimize model selection

### For Research Organizations

* **Resource Sharing**: Share expensive model access across research teams
* **Usage Monitoring**: Track research spending and resource utilization
* **Collaboration**: Enable seamless collaboration on AI projects
* **Reporting**: Generate usage reports for grant applications and budget planning

# Provider Integration

> Learn how to integrate your AI models with OpenRouter. Complete guide for providers to make their models available through OpenRouter's unified API.

## For Providers

If you'd like to be a model provider and sell inference on OpenRouter, [fill out our form](https://openrouter.ai/how-to-list) to get started.

To be eligible to provide inference on OpenRouter you must have the following:

### 1. List Models Endpoint

You must implement an endpoint that returns all models that should be served by OpenRouter. At this endpoint, please return a list of all available models on your platform. Below is an example of the response format:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      // Required
      "id": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
      "name": "Anthropic: Claude Sonnet 4",
      "created": 1690502400,
      "input_modalities": ["text", "image", "file"],
      "output_modalities": ["text", "image", "file"],
      "quantization": "fp8",
      "context_length": 1000000,
      "max_output_length": 128000,
      "pricing": {
        "prompt": "0.000008", // pricing per 1 token
        "completion": "0.000024", // pricing per 1 token
        "image": "0", // pricing per 1 image
        "request": "0", // pricing per 1 request
        "input_cache_reads": "0", // pricing per 1 token
        "input_cache_writes": "0" // pricing per 1 token
      },
      "supported_sampling_parameters": ["temperature", "stop"],
      "supported_features": [
        "tools",
        "json_mode",
        "structured_outputs",
        "web_search",
        "reasoning"
      ],
      // Optional
      "description": "Anthropic's flagship model...",
      "openrouter": {
        "slug": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4"
      },
      "datacenters": [
        {
          "country_code": "US" // `Iso3166Alpha2Code`
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

NOTE: `pricing` fields are in string format to avoid floating point precision issues, and must be in USD.

Valid quantization values are: `int4`, `int8`, `fp4`, `fp6`, `fp8`, `fp16`, `bf16`, `fp32`.

Valid sampling parameters are: `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `repetition_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, `presence_penalty`, `stop`, `seed`.

Valid features are: `tools`, `json_mode`, `structured_outputs`, `web_search`, `reasoning`.

### 2. Auto Top Up or Invoicing

For OpenRouter to use the provider we must be able to pay for inference automatically. This can be done via auto top up or invoicing.

### 3. Uptime Monitoring & Traffic Routing

OpenRouter automatically monitors provider reliability and adjusts traffic routing based on uptime metrics. Your endpoint's uptime is calculated as: **successful requests ÷ total requests** (excluding user errors).

**Errors that affect your uptime:**

* Authentication issues (401)
* Payment failures (402)
* Model not found (404)
* All server errors (500+)
* Mid-stream errors
* Successful requests with error finish reasons

**Errors that DON'T affect uptime:**

* Bad requests (400) - user input errors
* Oversized payloads (413) - user input errors
* Rate limiting (429) - tracked separately
* Geographic restrictions (403) - tracked separately

**Traffic routing thresholds:**

* **Minimum data**: 100+ requests required before uptime calculation begins
* **Normal routing**: 95%+ uptime
* **Degraded status**: 80-94% uptime → receives lower priority
* **Down status**: \<80% uptime → only used as fallback

This system ensures traffic automatically flows to the most reliable providers while giving temporary issues time to resolve.

# Reasoning Tokens

> Learn how to use reasoning tokens to enhance AI model outputs. Implement step-by-step reasoning traces for better decision making and transparency.

For models that support it, the OpenRouter API can return **Reasoning Tokens**, also known as thinking tokens. OpenRouter normalizes the different ways of customizing the amount of reasoning tokens that the model will use, providing a unified interface across different providers.

Reasoning tokens provide a transparent look into the reasoning steps taken by a model. Reasoning tokens are considered output tokens and charged accordingly.

Reasoning tokens are included in the response by default if the model decides to output them. Reasoning tokens will appear in the `reasoning` field of each message, unless you decide to exclude them.

<Note title="Some reasoning models do not return their reasoning tokens">
  While most models and providers make reasoning tokens available in the
  response, some (like the OpenAI o-series and Gemini Flash Thinking) do not.
</Note>

## Controlling Reasoning Tokens

You can control reasoning tokens in your requests using the `reasoning` parameter:

```json
{
  "model": "your-model",
  "messages": [],
  "reasoning": {
    // One of the following (not both):
    "effort": "high", // Can be "high", "medium", or "low" (OpenAI-style)
    "max_tokens": 2000, // Specific token limit (Anthropic-style)

    // Optional: Default is false. All models support this.
    "exclude": false, // Set to true to exclude reasoning tokens from response

    // Or enable reasoning with the default parameters:
    "enabled": true // Default: inferred from `effort` or `max_tokens`
  }
}
```

The `reasoning` config object consolidates settings for controlling reasoning strength across different models. See the Note for each option below to see which models are supported and how other models will behave.

### Max Tokens for Reasoning

<Note title="Supported models">
  Currently supported by:

  <ul>
    <li>
      Gemini thinking models
    </li>

    <li>
      Anthropic reasoning models (by using the <code>reasoning.max\_tokens</code>{' '}
      parameter)
    </li>
  </ul>
</Note>

For models that support reasoning token allocation, you can control it like this:

* `"max_tokens": 2000` - Directly specifies the maximum number of tokens to use for reasoning

For models that only support `reasoning.effort` (see below), the `max_tokens` value will be used to determine the effort level.

### Reasoning Effort Level

<Note title="Supported models">
  Currently supported by OpenAI reasoning models (o1 series, o3 series, GPT-5 series) and Grok models
</Note>

* `"effort": "high"` - Allocates a large portion of tokens for reasoning (approximately 80% of max\_tokens)
* `"effort": "medium"` - Allocates a moderate portion of tokens (approximately 50% of max\_tokens)
* `"effort": "low"` - Allocates a smaller portion of tokens (approximately 20% of max\_tokens)

For models that only support `reasoning.max_tokens`, the effort level will be set based on the percentages above.

### Excluding Reasoning Tokens

If you want the model to use reasoning internally but not include it in the response:

* `"exclude": true` - The model will still use reasoning, but it won't be returned in the response

Reasoning tokens will appear in the `reasoning` field of each message.

### Enable Reasoning with Default Config

To enable reasoning with the default parameters:

* `"enabled": true` - Enables reasoning at the "medium" effort level with no exclusions.

## Legacy Parameters

For backward compatibility, OpenRouter still supports the following legacy parameters:

* `include_reasoning: true` - Equivalent to `reasoning: {}`
* `include_reasoning: false` - Equivalent to `reasoning: { exclude: true }`

However, we recommend using the new unified `reasoning` parameter for better control and future compatibility.

## Examples

### Basic Usage with Reasoning Tokens

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: "openai/o3-mini"
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import requests
    import json

    url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    payload = {
        "model": "{{MODEL}}",
        "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "How would you build the world's tallest skyscraper?"}
        ],
        "reasoning": {
            "effort": "high"  # Use high reasoning effort
        }
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
    print(response.json()['choices'][0]['message']['reasoning'])
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import OpenAI from 'openai';

    const openai = new OpenAI({
      baseURL: 'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1',
      apiKey: '{{API_KEY_REF}}',
    });

    async function getResponseWithReasoning() {
      const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        messages: [
          {
            role: 'user',
            content: "How would you build the world's tallest skyscraper?",
          },
        ],
        reasoning: {
          effort: 'high', // Use high reasoning effort
        },
      });

      console.log('REASONING:', response.choices[0].message.reasoning);
      console.log('CONTENT:', response.choices[0].message.content);
    }

    getResponseWithReasoning();
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

### Using Max Tokens for Reasoning

For models that support direct token allocation (like Anthropic models), you can specify the exact number of tokens to use for reasoning:

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: "anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet"
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import requests
    import json

    url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    payload = {
        "model": "{{MODEL}}",
        "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "What's the most efficient algorithm for sorting a large dataset?"}
        ],
        "reasoning": {
            "max_tokens": 2000  # Allocate 2000 tokens (or approximate effort) for reasoning
        }
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
    print(response.json()['choices'][0]['message']['reasoning'])
    print(response.json()['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import OpenAI from 'openai';

    const openai = new OpenAI({
      baseURL: 'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1',
      apiKey: '{{API_KEY_REF}}',
    });

    async function getResponseWithReasoning() {
      const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        messages: [
          {
            role: 'user',
            content: "How would you build the world's tallest skyscraper?",
          },
        ],
        reasoning: {
          max_tokens: 2000, // Allocate 2000 tokens (or approximate effort) for reasoning
        },
      });

      console.log('REASONING:', response.choices[0].message.reasoning);
      console.log('CONTENT:', response.choices[0].message.content);
    }

    getResponseWithReasoning();
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

### Excluding Reasoning Tokens from Response

If you want the model to use reasoning internally but not include it in the response:

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: "deepseek/deepseek-r1"
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import requests
    import json

    url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    payload = {
        "model": "{{MODEL}}",
        "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms."}
        ],
        "reasoning": {
            "effort": "high",
            "exclude": true  # Use reasoning but don't include it in the response
        }
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
    # No reasoning field in the response
    print(response.json()['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import OpenAI from 'openai';

    const openai = new OpenAI({
      baseURL: 'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1',
      apiKey: '{{API_KEY_REF}}',
    });

    async function getResponseWithReasoning() {
      const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        messages: [
          {
            role: 'user',
            content: "How would you build the world's tallest skyscraper?",
          },
        ],
        reasoning: {
          effort: 'high',
          exclude: true, // Use reasoning but don't include it in the response
        },
      });

      console.log('REASONING:', response.choices[0].message.reasoning);
      console.log('CONTENT:', response.choices[0].message.content);
    }

    getResponseWithReasoning();
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

### Advanced Usage: Reasoning Chain-of-Thought

This example shows how to use reasoning tokens in a more complex workflow. It injects one model's reasoning into another model to improve its response quality:

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import requests
    import json

    question = "Which is bigger: 9.11 or 9.9?"

    url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    def do_req(model, content, reasoning_config=None):
        payload = {
            "model": model,
            "messages": [
                {"role": "user", "content": content}
            ],
            "stop": "</think>"
        }

        return requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

    # Get reasoning from a capable model
    content = f"{question} Please think this through, but don't output an answer"
    reasoning_response = do_req("deepseek/deepseek-r1", content)
    reasoning = reasoning_response.json()['choices'][0]['message']['reasoning']

    # Let's test! Here's the naive response:
    simple_response = do_req("openai/gpt-4o-mini", question)
    print(simple_response.json()['choices'][0]['message']['content'])

    # Here's the response with the reasoning token injected:
    content = f"{question}. Here is some context to help you: {reasoning}"
    smart_response = do_req("openai/gpt-4o-mini", content)
    print(smart_response.json()['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import OpenAI from 'openai';

    const openai = new OpenAI({
      baseURL: 'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1',
      apiKey,
    });

    async function doReq(model, content, reasoningConfig) {
      const payload = {
        model,
        messages: [{ role: 'user', content }],
        stop: '</think>',
        ...reasoningConfig,
      };

      return openai.chat.completions.create(payload);
    }

    async function getResponseWithReasoning() {
      const question = 'Which is bigger: 9.11 or 9.9?';
      const reasoningResponse = await doReq(
        'deepseek/deepseek-r1',
        `${question} Please think this through, but don't output an answer`,
      );
      const reasoning = reasoningResponse.choices[0].message.reasoning;

      // Let's test! Here's the naive response:
      const simpleResponse = await doReq('openai/gpt-4o-mini', question);
      console.log(simpleResponse.choices[0].message.content);

      // Here's the response with the reasoning token injected:
      const content = `${question}. Here is some context to help you: ${reasoning}`;
      const smartResponse = await doReq('openai/gpt-4o-mini', content);
      console.log(smartResponse.choices[0].message.content);
    }

    getResponseWithReasoning();
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

## Provider-Specific Reasoning Implementation

### Anthropic Models with Reasoning Tokens

The latest Claude models, such as [anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet](https://openrouter.ai/anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet), support working with and returning reasoning tokens.

You can enable reasoning on Anthropic models **only** using the unified `reasoning` parameter with either `effort` or `max_tokens`.

**Note:** The `:thinking` variant is no longer supported for Anthropic models. Use the `reasoning` parameter instead.

#### Reasoning Max Tokens for Anthropic Models

When using Anthropic models with reasoning:

* When using the `reasoning.max_tokens` parameter, that value is used directly with a minimum of 1024 tokens.
* When using the `reasoning.effort` parameter, the budget\_tokens are calculated based on the `max_tokens` value.

The reasoning token allocation is capped at 32,000 tokens maximum and 1024 tokens minimum. The formula for calculating the budget\_tokens is: `budget_tokens = max(min(max_tokens * {effort_ratio}, 32000), 1024)`

effort\_ratio is 0.8 for high effort, 0.5 for medium effort, and 0.2 for low effort.

**Important**: `max_tokens` must be strictly higher than the reasoning budget to ensure there are tokens available for the final response after thinking.

<Note title="Token Usage and Billing">
  Please note that reasoning tokens are counted as output tokens for billing
  purposes. Using reasoning tokens will increase your token usage but can
  significantly improve the quality of model responses.
</Note>

### Examples with Anthropic Models

#### Example 1: Streaming mode with reasoning tokens

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: "anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet"
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    from openai import OpenAI

    client = OpenAI(
        base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
        api_key="{{API_KEY_REF}}",
    )

    def chat_completion_with_reasoning(messages):
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="{{MODEL}}",
            messages=messages,
            max_tokens=10000,
            reasoning={
                "max_tokens": 8000  # Directly specify reasoning token budget
            },
            stream=True
        )
        return response

    for chunk in chat_completion_with_reasoning([
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's bigger, 9.9 or 9.11?"}
    ]):
        if hasattr(chunk.choices[0].delta, 'reasoning') and chunk.choices[0].delta.reasoning:
            print(f"REASONING: {chunk.choices[0].delta.reasoning}")
        elif chunk.choices[0].delta.content:
            print(f"CONTENT: {chunk.choices[0].delta.content}")
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import OpenAI from 'openai';

    const openai = new OpenAI({
      baseURL: 'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1',
      apiKey,
    });

    async function chatCompletionWithReasoning(messages) {
      const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        messages,
        maxTokens: 10000,
        reasoning: {
          maxTokens: 8000, // Directly specify reasoning token budget
        },
        stream: true,
      });

      return response;
    }

    (async () => {
      for await (const chunk of chatCompletionWithReasoning([
        { role: 'user', content: "What's bigger, 9.9 or 9.11?" },
      ])) {
        if (chunk.choices[0].delta.reasoning) {
          console.log(`REASONING: ${chunk.choices[0].delta.reasoning}`);
        } else if (chunk.choices[0].delta.content) {
          console.log(`CONTENT: ${chunk.choices[0].delta.content}`);
        }
      }
    })();
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

## Preserving Reasoning Blocks

<Note title="Model Support">
  The reasoning\_details are currently returned by all OpenAI reasoning models
  (o1 series, o3 series, GPT-5 series) and all Anthropic reasoning models
  (Claude 3.7, Claude 4, and Claude 4.1 series).
</Note>

The reasoning\_details functionality works identically across all supported reasoning models. You can easily switch between OpenAI reasoning models (like `openai/gpt-5-mini`) and Anthropic reasoning models (like `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`) without changing your code structure.

If you want to pass reasoning back in context, you must pass reasoning blocks back to the API. This is useful for maintaining the model's reasoning flow and conversation integrity.

Preserving reasoning blocks is useful specifically for tool calling. When models like Claude invoke tools, it is pausing its construction of a response to await external information. When tool results are returned, the model will continue building that existing response. This necessitates preserving reasoning blocks during tool use, for a couple of reasons:

**Reasoning continuity**: The reasoning blocks capture the model's step-by-step reasoning that led to tool requests. When you post tool results, including the original reasoning ensures the model can continue its reasoning from where it left off.

**Context maintenance**: While tool results appear as user messages in the API structure, they're part of a continuous reasoning flow. Preserving reasoning blocks maintains this conceptual flow across multiple API calls.

<Note title="Important for Reasoning Models">
  When providing reasoning\_details blocks, the entire sequence of consecutive
  reasoning blocks must match the outputs generated by the model during the
  original request; you cannot rearrange or modify the sequence of these blocks.
</Note>

## Responses API Shape

When reasoning models generate responses, the reasoning information is structured in a standardized format through the `reasoning_details` array. This section documents the API response structure for reasoning details in both streaming and non-streaming responses, based on the schema definitions in the `llm-interfaces` package.

### reasoning\_details Array Structure

The `reasoning_details` field contains an array of reasoning detail objects. Each object in the array represents a specific piece of reasoning information and follows one of three possible types. The location of this array differs between streaming and non-streaming responses:

* **Non-streaming responses**: `reasoning_details` appears in `choices[].message.reasoning_details`
* **Streaming responses**: `reasoning_details` appears in `choices[].delta.reasoning_details` for each chunk

#### Common Fields

All reasoning detail objects share these common fields:

* `id` (string | null): Unique identifier for the reasoning detail
* `format` (string): The format of the reasoning detail, with possible values:
  * `"unknown"` - Format is not specified
  * `"openai-responses-v1"` - OpenAI responses format version 1
  * `"anthropic-claude-v1"` - Anthropic Claude format version 1 (default)
* `index` (number, optional): Sequential index of the reasoning detail

#### Reasoning Detail Types

**1. Summary Type (`reasoning.summary`)**

Contains a high-level summary of the reasoning process:

```json
{
  "type": "reasoning.summary",
  "summary": "The model analyzed the problem by first identifying key constraints, then evaluating possible solutions...",
  "id": "reasoning-summary-1",
  "format": "anthropic-claude-v1",
  "index": 0
}
```

**2. Encrypted Type (`reasoning.encrypted`)**

Contains encrypted reasoning data that may be redacted or protected:

```json
{
  "type": "reasoning.encrypted",
  "data": "eyJlbmNyeXB0ZWQiOiJ0cnVlIiwiY29udGVudCI6IltSRURBQ1RFRF0ifQ==",
  "id": "reasoning-encrypted-1",
  "format": "anthropic-claude-v1",
  "index": 1
}
```

**3. Text Type (`reasoning.text`)**

Contains raw text reasoning with optional signature verification:

```json
{
  "type": "reasoning.text",
  "text": "Let me think through this step by step:\n1. First, I need to understand the user's question...",
  "signature": "sha256:abc123def456...",
  "id": "reasoning-text-1",
  "format": "anthropic-claude-v1",
  "index": 2
}
```

### Response Examples

#### Non-Streaming Response

In non-streaming responses, `reasoning_details` appears in the message:

```json
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Based on my analysis, I recommend the following approach...",
        "reasoning_details": [
          {
            "type": "reasoning.summary",
            "summary": "Analyzed the problem by breaking it into components",
            "id": "reasoning-summary-1",
            "format": "anthropic-claude-v1",
            "index": 0
          },
          {
            "type": "reasoning.text",
            "text": "Let me work through this systematically:\n1. First consideration...\n2. Second consideration...",
            "signature": null,
            "id": "reasoning-text-1",
            "format": "anthropic-claude-v1",
            "index": 1
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Streaming Response

In streaming responses, `reasoning_details` appears in delta chunks as the reasoning is generated:

```json
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "delta": {
        "reasoning_details": [
          {
            "type": "reasoning.text",
            "text": "Let me think about this step by step...",
            "signature": null,
            "id": "reasoning-text-1",
            "format": "anthropic-claude-v1",
            "index": 0
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Streaming Behavior Notes:**

* Each reasoning detail chunk is sent as it becomes available
* The `reasoning_details` array in each chunk may contain one or more reasoning objects
* For encrypted reasoning, the content may appear as `[REDACTED]` in streaming responses
* The complete reasoning sequence is built by concatenating all chunks in order

### Example: Preserving Reasoning Blocks with OpenRouter and Claude

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python
    from openai import OpenAI

    client = OpenAI(
        base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
        api_key="{{API_KEY_REF}}",
    )

    # First API call with tools
    # Note: You can use 'openai/gpt-5-mini' instead of 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4' - they're completely interchangeable
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="{{MODEL}}",
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in Boston? Then recommend what to wear."}
        ],
        tools=[{
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": "get_weather",
                "description": "Get current weather",
                "parameters": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {

                }
            }
        }],
        reasoning={"max_tokens": 2000}
    )

    # Extract the assistant message with reasoning_details
    message = response.choices[0].message

    # Preserve the complete reasoning_details when passing back
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in Boston? Then recommend what to wear."},
        {
            "role": "assistant",

# Usage Accounting

> Learn how to track AI model usage including prompt tokens, completion tokens, and cached tokens without additional API calls.

The OpenRouter API provides built-in **Usage Accounting** that allows you to track AI model usage without making additional API calls. This feature provides detailed information about token counts, costs, and caching status directly in your API responses.

## Usage Information

When enabled, the API will return detailed usage information including:

1. Prompt and completion token counts using the model's native tokenizer
2. Cost in credits
3. Reasoning token counts (if applicable)
4. Cached token counts (if available)

This information is included in the last SSE message for streaming responses, or in the complete response for non-streaming requests.

## Enabling Usage Accounting

You can enable usage accounting in your requests by including the `usage` parameter:

```json
{
  "model": "your-model",
  "messages": [],
  "usage": {
    "include": true
  }
}
```

## Response Format

When usage accounting is enabled, the response will include a `usage` object with detailed token information:

```json
{
  "object": "chat.completion.chunk",
  "usage": {
    "completion_tokens": 2,
    "completion_tokens_details": {
      "reasoning_tokens": 0
    },
    "cost": 0.95,
    "cost_details": {
      "upstream_inference_cost": 19
    },
    "prompt_tokens": 194,
    "prompt_tokens_details": {
      "cached_tokens": 0,
      "audio_tokens": 0
    },
    "total_tokens": 196
  }
}
```

`cached_tokens` is the number of tokens that were *read* from the cache. At this point in time, we do not support retrieving the number of tokens that were *written* to the cache.

## Cost Breakdown

The usage response includes detailed cost information:

* `cost`: The total amount charged to your account
* `cost_details.upstream_inference_cost`: The actual cost charged by the upstream AI provider

**Note:** The `upstream_inference_cost` field only applies to BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) requests.

<Note title="Performance Impact">
  Enabling usage accounting will add a few hundred milliseconds to the last
  response as the API calculates token counts and costs. This only affects the
  final message and does not impact overall streaming performance.
</Note>

## Benefits

1. **Efficiency**: Get usage information without making separate API calls
2. **Accuracy**: Token counts are calculated using the model's native tokenizer
3. **Transparency**: Track costs and cached token usage in real-time
4. **Detailed Breakdown**: Separate counts for prompt, completion, reasoning, and cached tokens

## Best Practices

1. Enable usage tracking when you need to monitor token consumption or costs
2. Account for the slight delay in the final response when usage accounting is enabled
3. Consider implementing usage tracking in development to optimize token usage before production
4. Use the cached token information to optimize your application's performance

## Alternative: Getting Usage via Generation ID

You can also retrieve usage information asynchronously by using the generation ID returned from your API calls. This is particularly useful when you want to fetch usage statistics after the completion has finished or when you need to audit historical usage.

To use this method:

1. Make your chat completion request as normal
2. Note the `id` field in the response
3. Use that ID to fetch usage information via the `/generation` endpoint

For more details on this approach, see the [Get a Generation](/docs/api-reference/get-a-generation) documentation.

## Examples

### Basic Usage with Token Tracking

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: "anthropic/claude-3-opus"
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import requests
    import json

    url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    payload = {
        "model": "{{MODEL}}",
        "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}
        ],
        "usage": {
            "include": True
        }
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
    print("Response:", response.json()['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
    print("Usage Stats:", response.json()['usage'])
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import OpenAI from 'openai';

    const openai = new OpenAI({
      baseURL: 'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1',
      apiKey: '{{API_KEY_REF}}',
    });

    async function getResponseWithUsage() {
      const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        messages: [
          {
            role: 'user',
            content: 'What is the capital of France?',
          },
        ],
        extra_body: {
          usage: {
            include: true,
          },
        },
      });

      console.log('Response:', response.choices[0].message.content);
      console.log('Usage Stats:', response.usage);
    }

    getResponseWithUsage();
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

### Streaming with Usage Information

This example shows how to handle usage information in streaming mode:

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: "anthropic/claude-3-opus"
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    from openai import OpenAI

    client = OpenAI(
        base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
        api_key="{{API_KEY_REF}}",
    )

    def chat_completion_with_usage(messages):
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="{{MODEL}}",
            messages=messages,
            usage={
              "include": True
            },
            stream=True
        )
        return response

    for chunk in chat_completion_with_usage([
        {"role": "user", "content": "Write a haiku about Paris."}
    ]):
        if hasattr(chunk, 'usage'):
            if hasattr(chunk.usage, 'total_tokens'):
                print(f"\nUsage Statistics:")
                print(f"Total Tokens: {chunk.usage.total_tokens}")
                print(f"Prompt Tokens: {chunk.usage.prompt_tokens}")
                print(f"Completion Tokens: {chunk.usage.completion_tokens}")
                print(f"Cost: {chunk.usage.cost} credits")
        elif chunk.choices[0].delta.content:
            print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end="")
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import OpenAI from 'openai';

    const openai = new OpenAI({
      baseURL: 'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1',
      apiKey: '{{API_KEY_REF}}',
    });

    async function chatCompletionWithUsage(messages) {
      const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        messages,
        usage: {
          include: true,
        },
        stream: true,
      });

      return response;
    }

    (async () => {
      for await (const chunk of chatCompletionWithUsage([
        { role: 'user', content: 'Write a haiku about Paris.' },
      ])) {
        if (chunk.usage) {
          console.log('\nUsage Statistics:');
          console.log(`Total Tokens: ${chunk.usage.total_tokens}`);
          console.log(`Prompt Tokens: ${chunk.usage.prompt_tokens}`);
          console.log(`Completion Tokens: ${chunk.usage.completion_tokens}`);
          console.log(`Cost: ${chunk.usage.cost} credits`);
        } else if (chunk.choices[0].delta.content) {
          process.stdout.write(chunk.choices[0].delta.content);
        }
      }
    })();
    ```

# User Tracking

> Learn how to use the user parameter to track your own user IDs with OpenRouter. Improve caching performance and get detailed reporting on your sub-users.

The OpenRouter API supports **User Tracking** through the optional `user` parameter, allowing you to track your own user IDs and improve your application's performance and reporting capabilities.

## What is User Tracking?

User tracking enables you to specify an arbitrary string identifier for your end-users in API requests. This optional metadata helps OpenRouter understand your sub-users, leading to several benefits:

1. **Improved Caching**: OpenRouter can make caches sticky to your individual users, improving load-balancing and throughput
2. **Enhanced Reporting**: View detailed analytics and activity feeds broken down by your user IDs

## How It Works

Simply include a `user` parameter in your API requests with any string identifier that represents your end-user. This could be a user ID, email hash, session identifier, or any other stable identifier you use in your application.

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}
  ],
  "user": "user_12345"
}
```

## Benefits

### Improved Caching Performance

When you consistently use the same user identifier for a specific user, OpenRouter can optimize caching to be "sticky" to that user. This means:

* A given user of your application (assuming you are using caching) will always get routed to the same provider and the cache will stay warm
* But separate users can be spread over different providers, improving load-balancing and throughput

### Enhanced Reporting and Analytics

The user parameter is available in the /activity page, in the exports from that page, and in the /generations API.

* **Activity Feed**: View requests broken down by user ID in your OpenRouter dashboard
* **Usage Analytics**: Understand which users are making the most requests
* **Export Data**: Get detailed exports that include user-level breakdowns

## Implementation Example

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: "openai/gpt-4o"
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import requests
    import json

    url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    payload = {
        "model": "{{MODEL}}",
        "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like today?"}
        ],
        "user": "user_12345"  # Your user identifier
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
    print(response.json()['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    import OpenAI from 'openai';

    const openai = new OpenAI({
      baseURL: 'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1',
      apiKey: '{{API_KEY_REF}}',
    });

    async function chatWithUserTracking() {
      const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: '{{MODEL}}',
        messages: [
          {
            role: 'user',
            content: "What's the weather like today?",
          },
        ],
        user: 'user_12345', // Your user identifier
      });

      console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
    }

    chatWithUserTracking();
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

## Best Practices

### Choose Stable Identifiers

Use consistent, stable identifiers for the same user across requests:

* **Good**: `user_12345`, `customer_abc123`, `account_xyz789`
* **Avoid**: Random strings that change between requests

### Consider Privacy

When using user identifiers, consider privacy implications:

* Use internal user IDs rather than exposing personal information
* Avoid including personally identifiable information in user identifiers
* Consider using anonymized identifiers for better privacy protection

### Be Consistent

Use the same user identifier format throughout your application:

```python
# Consistent format
user_id = f"app_{internal_user_id}"
```

# Mastra

> Integrate OpenRouter using Mastra framework. Complete guide for Mastra integration with OpenRouter for unified AI model access.

## Mastra

Integrate OpenRouter with Mastra to access a variety of AI models through a unified interface. This guide provides complete examples from basic setup to advanced configurations.

### Step 1: Initialize a new Mastra project

The simplest way to start is using the automatic project creation:

```bash
# Create a new project using create-mastra
npx create-mastra@latest
```

You'll be guided through prompts to set up your project. For this example, select:

* Name your project: my-mastra-openrouter-app
* Components: Agents (recommended)
* For default provider, select OpenAI (recommended) - we'll configure OpenRouter manually later
* Optionally include example code

For detailed instructions on setting up a Mastra project manually or adding Mastra to an existing project, refer to the [official Mastra documentation](https://mastra.ai/en/docs/getting-started/installation).

### Step 2: Configure your environment variables

After creating your project with `create-mastra`, you'll find a `.env.development` file in your project root. Since we selected OpenAI during setup but will be using OpenRouter instead:

1. Open the `.env.development` file
2. Remove or comment out the `OPENAI_API_KEY` line
3. Add your OpenRouter API key:

```
# .env.development
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key  # Comment out or remove this line
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-your-api-key-here
```

You can also remove the `@ai-sdk/openai` package since we'll be using OpenRouter instead:

```bash
npm uninstall @ai-sdk/openai
```

```bash
npm install @openrouter/ai-sdk-provider
```

### Step 3: Configure your agent to use OpenRouter

After setting up your Mastra project, you'll need to modify the agent files to use OpenRouter instead of the default OpenAI provider.

If you used `create-mastra`, you'll likely have a file at `src/mastra/agents/agent.ts` or similar. Replace its contents with:

```typescript
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent';
import { createOpenRouter } from '@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider';

// Initialize OpenRouter provider
const openrouter = createOpenRouter({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
});

// Create an agent
export const assistant = new Agent({
  model: openrouter('anthropic/claude-3-opus'),
  name: 'Assistant',
  instructions:
    'You are a helpful assistant with expertise in technology and science.',
});
```

Also make sure to update your Mastra entry point at `src/mastra/index.ts` to use your renamed agent:

```typescript
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';

import { assistant } from './agents/agent'; // Update the import path if you used a different filename

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { assistant }, // Use the same name here as you exported from your agent file
});
```

### Step 4: Running the Application

Once you've configured your agent to use OpenRouter, you can run the Mastra development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Mastra development server and make your agent available at:

* REST API endpoint: `http://localhost:4111/api/agents/assistant/generate`
* Interactive playground: `http://localhost:4111`

The Mastra playground provides a user-friendly interface where you can interact with your agent and test its capabilities without writing any additional code.

You can also test the API endpoint using curl if needed:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4111/api/agents/assistant/generate \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"messages": ["What are the latest advancements in quantum computing?"]}'
```

### Basic Integration with Mastra

The simplest way to integrate OpenRouter with Mastra is by using the OpenRouter AI provider with Mastra's Agent system:

```typescript
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent';
import { createOpenRouter } from '@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider';

// Initialize the OpenRouter provider
const openrouter = createOpenRouter({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
});

// Create an agent using OpenRouter
const assistant = new Agent({
  model: openrouter('anthropic/claude-3-opus'),
  name: 'Assistant',
  instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
});

// Generate a response
const response = await assistant.generate([
  {
    role: 'user',
    content: 'Tell me about renewable energy sources.',
  },
]);

console.log(response.text);
```

### Advanced Configuration

For more control over your OpenRouter requests, you can pass additional configuration options:

```typescript
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent';
import { createOpenRouter } from '@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider';

// Initialize with advanced options
const openrouter = createOpenRouter({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
  extraBody: {
    reasoning: {
      max_tokens: 10,
    },
  },
});

// Create an agent with model-specific options
const chefAgent = new Agent({
  model: openrouter('anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet', {
    extraBody: {
      reasoning: {
        max_tokens: 10,
      },
    },
  }),
  name: 'Chef',
  instructions: 'You are a chef assistant specializing in French cuisine.',
});
```

### Provider-Specific Options

You can also pass provider-specific options in your requests:

```typescript
// Get a response with provider-specific options
const response = await chefAgent.generate([
  {
    role: 'system',
    content:
      'You are Chef Michel, a culinary expert specializing in ketogenic (keto) diet...',
    providerOptions: {
      // Provider-specific options - key can be 'anthropic' or 'openrouter'
      anthropic: {
        cacheControl: { type: 'ephemeral' },
      },
    },
  },
  {
    role: 'user',
    content: 'Can you suggest a keto breakfast?',
  },
]);
```

### Using Multiple Models with OpenRouter

OpenRouter gives you access to various models from different providers. Here's how to use multiple models:

```typescript
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent';
import { createOpenRouter } from '@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider';

const openrouter = createOpenRouter({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
});

// Create agents using different models
const claudeAgent = new Agent({
  model: openrouter('anthropic/claude-3-opus'),
  name: 'ClaudeAssistant',
  instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant powered by Claude.',
});

const gptAgent = new Agent({
  model: openrouter('openai/gpt-4'),
  name: 'GPTAssistant',
  instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant powered by GPT-4.',
});

// Use different agents based on your needs
const claudeResponse = await claudeAgent.generate([
  {
    role: 'user',
    content: 'Explain quantum mechanics simply.',
  },
]);
console.log(claudeResponse.text);

const gptResponse = await gptAgent.generate([
  {
    role: 'user',
    content: 'Explain quantum mechanics simply.',
  },
]);
console.log(gptResponse.text);
```

# Langfuse

> Integrate OpenRouter using Langfuse for observability and tracing. Complete guide for Langfuse integration with OpenRouter for Python applications.

## Using Langfuse

[Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) provides observability and analytics for LLM applications. Since OpenRouter uses the OpenAI API schema, you can utilize Langfuse's native integration with the OpenAI SDK to automatically trace and monitor your OpenRouter API calls.

### Installation

```bash
pip install langfuse openai
```

### Configuration

Set up your environment variables:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python title="Environment Setup"
  import os

  # Set your Langfuse API keys
  LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY="sk-lf-..."
  LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY="pk-lf-..."
  # EU region
  LANGFUSE_HOST="https://cloud.langfuse.com"
  # US region
  # LANGFUSE_HOST="https://us.cloud.langfuse.com"

  # Set your OpenRouter API key
  os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "${API_KEY_REF}"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Simple LLM Call

Since OpenRouter provides an OpenAI-compatible API, you can use the Langfuse OpenAI SDK wrapper to automatically log OpenRouter calls as generations in Langfuse:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python title="Basic Integration"
  # Import the Langfuse OpenAI SDK wrapper
  from langfuse.openai import openai

  # Create an OpenAI client with OpenRouter's base URL
  client = openai.OpenAI(
      base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
      default_headers={
          "HTTP-Referer": "<YOUR_SITE_URL>",  # Optional: Your site URL
          "X-Title": "<YOUR_SITE_NAME>",      # Optional: Your site name
      }
  )

  # Make a chat completion request
  response = client.chat.completions.create(
      model="anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet",
      messages=[
          {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
          {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a fun fact about space."}
      ],
      name="fun-fact-request"  # Optional: Name of the generation in Langfuse
  )

  # Print the assistant's reply
  print(response.choices[0].message.content)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Advanced Tracing with Nested Calls

Use the `@observe()` decorator to capture execution details of functions with nested LLM calls:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python title="Nested Function Tracing"
  from langfuse import observe
  from langfuse.openai import openai

  # Create an OpenAI client with OpenRouter's base URL
  client = openai.OpenAI(
      base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
  )

  @observe()  # This decorator enables tracing of the function
  def analyze_text(text: str):
      # First LLM call: Summarize the text
      summary_response = summarize_text(text)
      summary = summary_response.choices[0].message.content

      # Second LLM call: Analyze the sentiment of the summary
      sentiment_response = analyze_sentiment(summary)
      sentiment = sentiment_response.choices[0].message.content

      return {
          "summary": summary,
          "sentiment": sentiment
      }

  @observe()  # Nested function to be traced
  def summarize_text(text: str):
      return client.chat.completions.create(
          model="openai/gpt-3.5-turbo",
          messages=[
              {"role": "system", "content": "You summarize texts in a concise manner."},
              {"role": "user", "content": f"Summarize the following text:\n{text}"}
          ],
          name="summarize-text"
      )

  @observe()  # Nested function to be traced
  def analyze_sentiment(summary: str):
      return client.chat.completions.create(
          model="openai/gpt-3.5-turbo",
          messages=[
              {"role": "system", "content": "You analyze the sentiment of texts."},
              {"role": "user", "content": f"Analyze the sentiment of the following summary:\n{summary}"}
          ],
          name="analyze-sentiment"
      )

  # Example usage
  text_to_analyze = "OpenRouter's unified API has significantly advanced the field of AI development, setting new standards for model accessibility."
  result = analyze_text(text_to_analyze)
  print(result)
  ```

# List models filtered by user provider preferences

GET https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models/user

Returns a list of models available through the API, filtered based on the user's provider preferences.
This endpoint returns the same data structure as `/models` but only includes models from providers that are not in the user's ignored providers list and are either in the user's allowed providers list (if configured) or from any provider (if no allowed providers are specified).
These provider preferences can be configured on the /settings page.

# Get Activity

GET https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/activity

Returns daily user activity data grouped by model endpoint for the last 30 (completed) UTC days.

If ingesting on a schedule, it is recommended to wait for ~30 minutes after the UTC boundary to
request the previous day, because events are aggregated by request start time, and some reasoning
models may take a few minutes to complete.

Note that a [provisioning key](https://openrouter.ai/settings/provisioning-keys) is required to
access this endpoint, to ensure that your historic usage is not accessible
to just anyone in your org with an inference API key.
