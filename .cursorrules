# Cursor Rules for CLI-PHP-CYOA-Game

## Core Development Principles

### 1. NO TEST FILE CREATION
- **NEVER** create new test files (e.g., test_*.php, test-*.php, *_test.php)
- **NEVER** create temporary debugging scripts
- **NEVER** create one-off utility files for testing
- Work directly with production files only
- Use existing files for testing: game.php with appropriate flags

### 2. File Management Rules
- **MODIFY** existing files rather than creating new ones
- **DELETE** any temporary test files if they exist
- **USE** command-line flags for testing (--debug, --setup, --config, etc.)
- **LEVERAGE** existing utilities: fetch_models.php, migrate.php are acceptable as they serve production purposes

### 3. Testing Approach
- Test functionality by running the actual game: `php game.php`
- Use debug mode for troubleshooting: `php game.php --debug`
- Verify configurations with: `php game.php --config`
- Test provider setup with: `php game.php --setup`

### 4. Code Quality Standards
- All code changes must be made to production files
- Maintain backward compatibility when updating
- Ensure error handling is robust in production code
- Add debug logging to production code rather than creating test scripts

### 5. Forbidden Actions
❌ Creating files like:
- test_providers.php
- test_game_start.php
- test_venice.php
- debug_*.php
- check_*.php
- verify_*.php
- Any temporary testing scripts

### 6. Allowed Actions
✅ Working with:
- game.php (main game file)
- app/*.php (application components)
- fetch_models.php (production utility)
- migrate.php (migration utility)
- config files and documentation

### 7. Problem-Solving Approach
When encountering issues:
1. First, check existing debug output in production code
2. Add debug logging to production files if needed
3. Use command-line flags to test specific features
4. Fix issues directly in production code
5. Remove any accidentally created test files

### 8. Documentation Updates
- Update README.md with any new features or changes
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes
- Document command-line options and configurations

## Remember
**Production-first development**: Every change should improve the actual game, not create testing infrastructure. The game itself IS the test environment when run with appropriate flags.
