## Security Considerations

- **API Key Storage**

  - Your API key is stored in a hidden file named `.openai_api_key` in the project directory.
  - The file permissions are set to `0600`, making it readable and writable only by your user account.

- **Protecting Your API Key**

  - **Do Not Share:** Never share your API key or commit it to any public repository.
  - **Revoking Access:** If you believe your API key has been compromised, revoke it immediately from your OpenAI account settings.

- **File Permissions**

  - Ensure that the project directory is secure and not accessible by unauthorized users.
  - Verify file permissions if you're running the script on a shared system.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **PHP Not Recognized**

   - **Error Message:** `'php' is not recognized as an internal or external command...`
   - **Solution:** Ensure PHP is installed and added to your system's PATH variable.

2. **Invalid API Key**

   - **Error Message:** `API Error Message: Incorrect API key provided`
   - **Solution:** Double-check your API key for typos and ensure it's valid.

3. **API Connection Errors**

   - **Error Message:** `Request Error: Could not resolve host: api.openai.com`
   - **Solution:** Check your internet connection and DNS settings.

4. **SSL Certificate Issues**

   - **Error Message:** `SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate`
   - **Solution:** Update your system's CA certificates or disable SSL verification (not recommended).

     ```php
     // Add this line before executing the API request
     curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false);
     ```

     **Warning:** Disabling SSL verification can expose you to security risks.

5. **Permission Denied**

   - **Error Message:** `Permission denied` when accessing `.openai_api_key`
   - **Solution:** Ensure you have read/write permissions for the project directory and files.

## Customization

- **Changing the Game Theme**

  - Open `game.php` in a text editor.
  - Locate the `$system_prompt` variable.

    $system_prompt = "You are an interactive sci-fi adventure game set in space...";
    ```

- **Adjusting API Parameters**

  - Modify parameters like `max_tokens` and `temperature` in the `$data` array to change response length and creativity.

    ```php
    'max_tokens' => 250,
    'temperature' => 0.9,
    ```
